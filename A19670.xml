            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>According as Ieſus Christ hath taught, I doe loue both your ſoule and body: and doe wiſhe both to be ſaued, by the bloud of that vnſpotted Lambe, that by his death and bloudſhedding, hath paide a ſufficient raunſome for the ſinnes of the whole worlde.</p>
            <p>The errours that you haue taught, I doe vtterly abhorre, as detestable and damnable: wyſhing you and all other to doe the ſame. Embraceing now at the laſt, the knowne truth: which hath bene long time hid by ignoraunce, from the greateſt number that bare the name of Chriſtians, and is nowe by the knowledge of the holye worde of God, made knowne, to as many as will knowe it, and be not wilfull blinde.</p>
            <p>Such truth as you haue taught, I doe wyllingly embrace: and doe not any thing at all, miſlike with any thing, for the Authors ſake. But my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking is, with the matter that is not to be lyked. And when I doe at any time ſeme to miſlike with the Author, it is for that his words haue no grounde in the holy worde of God, which is as the touchſtone to trie all mens writings by.</p>
            <p>Let vs both pray for the ſpirite of Humilitie, that we may thereby be made meete to receyue and retaine the knowledge of the truth: which God will neuer giue to the prowde, and ſuch as thinke themſelues peereleſse, and therefore diſdaine the brotherly admonitions of ſuch as in their ſight are to ſimple, to be teachers of ſuch as they be.</p>
            <p>The Lorde Ieſus graunt that ſpirite to as many as profeſse his name: that we may once be of one minde in the houſe of the Lorde, to his glorie, and the confuſion of Satan. Amen.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing occaſion oftentymes to be in place where ſuche as are not yet perſwaded that the Popes Church can erre, haue bene bolde to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their minds fréely, affirming that the doctrine which the Proteſtants teache, is erronious and falſe, eſpecially concerning the preſence of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body and bloud, and the ſacrifice of the Maſſe: I haue perceyued, that the ſame haue bene chiefely perſwaded &amp; ſtayed by theſe two Sermons, made by Doctor Watſon in the firſt yere of Quéene Maries reigne. I haue therefore wyſhed, that ſome man of lyke learning, would haue publiſhed in print, an anſwere to thoſe Sermons: that thereby ſuch as haue bene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued by the ſubtiltie thereof, might by the plaine and ſimple aunſwere, be brought to the knowledge of the truth, which no doubt the greateſt number of them would embrace, if they might once be brought to ſée it. Yea, I know ſome of them doe hunger and thirſt, to ſée what may be ſayde to the contrarie of that which they are yet perſwaded in, by that which ſéemeth to them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunſwerable.</p>
            <p>But whiles I thus wyſhed with my ſelfe, many yeares are paſſed by: and I feare me, manye ſoules haue periſhed, being blinded by the ſubtilty of theſe Sermons. And hitherto, I can not vnderſtand that any man hath once purpoſed to aunſwere them.</p>
            <p>Although therefore, I be of many the moſt vnméete, and of ſome moſt diſpiſed, accounted and reported to be none of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: yet rather then the prowde Philiſtine ſhould ſtill blaſpheme the God of Iſraell, and defie his whole armie, no man being ſo hardie as to buckle with him, I haue in the courage and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of diſpiſed Dauid, taken in hande to fight the combat with him, and doe not doubt by the helpe of Dauids God, eyther to cauſe him to yéelde, or to lye headleſſe, diſpiſed and forſaken euen of his owne ſort and folowers.</p>
            <p>Some man will ſay (peraduenture) that it is but a vayne bragge to make ſuch a chalenge, knowing that the aduerſe party
<pb facs="tcp:9612:5"/> may not without lycence encounter with mée: and if he ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne lycence, yet ſhall not his doings be ſuffered to come to light, vnleſſe the ſame ſhall be lyked by ſuch as fauour my cauſe. For my part, I wiſhe that it were as frée for him to replye to thys mine aunſwere and to publiſhe the ſame, as it is for mée to aunſwere his Sermons: and I know that if he be able and wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to replie, he can neyther lack libertie ſo to doe, nor meanes to publiſh it when it is done. This obiection therfore is but vaine.</p>
            <p>But that you may haue ſome vnderſtanding of that which I haue done in this aunſwere (deare Chriſtians) and with better will read it thorowe and weigh it: I will in fewe wordes declare the effect of my doing therein. Firſt, I haue faythfully reported the Sermons, as they are to be ſéene in his printed Copie: alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or chaunging no one ſillable or letter, but ſuch onely as doe manifeſtly appéere to be faultes eſcaped by the ignoraunce or negligence of the Printer. Secondly, I haue weighed and conſidered the Authorities that he hath alledged with their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: ſetting downe the ſame in wryting to be ſéene, that you may in the feare of God, weigh the ſame alſo, and iudge whether he haue applied them aright or not. And thirdly, I haue aunſwered, by the lyke, or greater Authoritie, all that he hath laboured to confirme by Authoritie: eyther of the ſcriptures or auncient fathers.</p>
            <p>The Lorde Ieſus direct you all in the reading of theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and aunſwere: that you may vnderſtande and embrace the truth of the matters in controuerſie, &amp; in life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, glorifie him that hath with his ſpirite of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort cauſed mée to go thorow wyth this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: notwithſtanding the manifold waies that Sathan hath ſought to cauſe me to caſt it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. Fare you well.</p>

            <q>Two notable Sermons, made the thirde and fift Fridayes in Lent laſt paſt, before the Queenes Highneſſe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Reall preſence of Chriſts bodie and bloud in the bleſſed ſacrament, and alſo the Maſſe, which is the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the new Teſtament: by Thomas Watſon Doctor of Diuinitie.</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue hearde that in the dayes of King Henrie the eight: there preached one before him,<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> whoſe Sermon the King liked not, bicauſe it was not to be liked. And therfore he willed Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas More then being Lorde Chauncelor: to giue the Preacher thankes, worthie ſuch a Sermon. He therfore being a man of a pleaſant wit, ſpake to the Preacher with a lowde voyce, that the King might heare, and ſayde:<note place="margin">Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Mores thankes.</note> The Kings Maieſtie thanketh you for your notable Sermon. Which when the King heard, he called Sir Thomas to him, and ſayde: What meane you my Lorde to giue ſuch thankes in our name? If it lyke you, quoth hée, there be ſome thinges notable euill. Whether the Printer ment ſo of theſe two Sermons, I knowe not. But I truſt that the Reader ſhall perceyue, by the ſetting open of the ſubtiltie thereof: that they were not notable good.</p>

               <hi>If S. Paule writing to the Philippians, the thirde chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was not aſhamed to ſaye, to write one thing diuers times to you, is not paine or ſloth to mee, but profitable and neceſſarie for you: much leſſe ought I to be aſhamed, for that I propounde to you at this time, that leſſon againe which before I haue twiſe entreated, ſeeing I intende (by Gods grace) to ſpeak nothing, but that I haue learned either of S. Paule himſelfe, or of ſuch as I think was endued with the ſame ſpirit that S. Paule was. And this I do, not for lack of good matter: but for lack of better matter in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; more neceſſary to be learned of vs al at this preſent.</hi>

               <hi>For what is better, worthyer, and more needefull to bee taught and learned of all ſortes of men, in theſe euill dayes and corrupt time: then how to offer vp our ſelues to God, a liuing, holy and pleaſing ſacrifice, to ouercome and repreſſe our naughtie will and affections? to mortifie our earthlye members and conuerſation? And ſo to baniſh ſinne, that it reigne not in our mortall bodies? the largeneſſe of which matter is ſo great, and doth extende it ſelfe in ſo many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, cauſes, and circumſtances: that although the whole matter doe pertayne and haue reſpect to one ende: yet the intreating of it being long, muſt needes be various, and for that reaſon can not be tedious, to him that loueth to learne to liue well, and pleaſe almightie God.</hi>

               <hi>to deſtroye the kingdome of ſinne, for which purpoſe, Gods ſonne was incarnate, to bring which thing to paſſe, in vs was all the life, the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, the paſsion, the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and all the doctrine and ſacramentes of Chriſt. Like as contrarie, to erect and eſtabliſh this kingdome of ſinne is al the trauaile and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the deuill, now fawning lyke a ſerpent, tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himſelfe into an aungell of light, to entrappe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſimple and vnware, nowe raging like a Lion, to ouerthrow the feble and fearefull. And not only is it his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: but alſo it is the whole labour and practiſe, of all his children by imitation. As Infidels, Iewes, Heretiks, Sciſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, falſe brethren, and counterfet chriſtians, both in ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and learning, labouring night and daye with all witte and will: to deſtroye the fayth of Chriſt, the ſacraments of Chriſt, and the ſacrifice of Chriſt, as much as in them lieth.

            </p>
            <p>It is verie true (as you ſay) that the ende of our mortification,<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> the incarnation, life, ſuffering, reſurrection, doctrine and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt: is to deſtroy the kingdome of ſinne.<note place="margin">Watſons words true in himſelfe, &amp; ſuch other.</note> And on the contrary, it is all true that you haue written: vnderſtanding your ſelfe and other of your ſort, to be the Heretikes, Sciſmatikes, falſe brethren and counterfet Chriſtians that you ſpeake off.</p>

               <hi>I haue partlye touched, and by Gods grace and your paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhall now procede further. I haue opened the decay of fayth, good workes and penance, which be remedies againſt ſinne. One other remedie there is, that lieth in much decay,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9612:11"/> which will lye ſtill, except good men (according to their bounden dueties) put to their helping handes. I meane the ſacrifice of the church, the ſacrifice of the newe teſtament, the ſacrifice of our reconciliation, in the bodie and bloude of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, which he hath inſtituted in hys laſt ſupper, and ſo as <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſayth, <hi>Noui testamenti, nouam docuit oblationem:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ireneus. li. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>32.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>quam Eccleſia ab Apostolis accipiens, in vniuerſo mundo offert deo:</hi> Chriſt confeſsing, the cup to be his bloud, hath taught the newe ſacrifice of the newe teſtament: which ſacrifice, the Church receyuing of the Apoſtles, doth offer to God throughout the whole worlde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note>You ſay you haue opened the decaye of faith, good workes and penance. I haue neyther hearde nor ſéene in writing, what you haue ſayd of theſe decayes. But me thinke I maye geſſe that you doe account it a decaye of faith, when men can not beléeue, that whatſoeuer the Pope and his Clearkes ſhall teach, is true: of good workes, when men waxe werie of giuing their landes and goods to the maintenaunce of Idolatrie,<note place="margin">Maiſter Watſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of faith, good works, and penance.</note> and falſe worſhipping of God: and of penance, when men can not be perſwaded, that their owne works can be any part of ſatiſfaction for their owne ſinnes. If this be your opening of theſe decayes: then haue you done as well therein, as you doe here in the decaye of the fourth reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which you call the ſacrifice of the Church. &amp;c. For neither may the ſupper of the Lorde bée properlye called the ſacrifice of the Church, the ſacrifice of the new Teſtament, nor the ſacrifice of our reconciliation: more than to beléeue all that the Pope ſhall teach, may be called the faith in Chriſt, or to giue lands or goodes to the maintenance of Idolatrie, may be called a good worke, or the ſéeking to ſatiſfie for ſinnes, by our owne workes, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led penance.</p>
            <p>And as for your wordes cited out of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> they are not ſo many as they ſhould be, and therfore I will cite them as <hi>Ireneus</hi> wrote them, although it be ſomething long, that the ſimple Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be no longer deceyued by your ſubtile handling of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers writings.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe be the words, ſayth he, that you muſt fulfill in déede. Let euerie one of you ſpeake truth to his neighbour, and ſée that ye
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9612:12"/> giue quiet ſentence in your gates, and let no man kéepe in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie the malice of his brother. And ſée that you take no falſe othe. For the Almightie Lorde doth hate all theſe things. And in like maner <hi>Dauid.</hi> What man is it, ſayth he, that is deſirous of life, and loueth to ſée good dayes? Reſtraine thy tongue from euill, and thy lips that they ſpeake no guile. Decline from euill and doe good, ſéeke after peace and follow the ſame. By all which words it is manifeſt, that God required of them neither ſacrifice nor burnt offerings. But faith and obedience, and righteouſneſſe, for their ſaluation. Euen as in <hi>Oſeas</hi> the Prophete alſo, God teaching them his will, ſayd: I deſire rather mercye than ſacrifice, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of God, more than burnt offerings. And our Lorde alſo did put them in remembraunce of the ſame thinges when he ſayde: trulye if ye had knowen what this meaneth, I deſire mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie rather than ſacrifice: ye woulde neuer condemne thoſe that deſerue it not. Teſtifying with the Prophetes, that it was the truth that they taught, and reprehending thoſe that he ſpake too, as men that by their owne fault were without vnderſtanding. Alſo when he gaue counſell to his Diſciples, that they ſhoulde of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto God, firſt fruites out of his creatures: not as though he had néede thereof, but that they ſhould neyther be vnfruitfull nor vnthankfull: he tooke the breade, which is of the Creature, and gaue thankes, ſaying. This is my bodye. And in like maner, he confeſſed, that the Cup, which is of that creature that is among vs, is his bloude, and taught a newe oblation of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Church receyuing of the Apoſtles, doth in all parts of the world offer vnto God, euen vnto him that giueth the firſt fruites of his owne giftes in the newe Teſtament, to be oure foode, wherof in the twelue Prophetes, <hi>Malachie</hi> doth foreſhow in this ſort. I haue no pleaſure in you, ſayth the Lorde almightie: and I will receiue no ſacrifice at your handes. For my name is glorified among the Gentiles, euen from the riſing of the ſunne to the going downe of the ſame, and in euery place is Incenſe and pure ſacrifice offred vnto my name. For my name is great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Nations, ſayth the Lorde almightie: declaring moſte manifeſtly by theſe words, that the firſt people ſhall ceaſe to offer
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9612:12"/> to God: but in euerie place is ſacrifice offered vnto him, yea, and that pure ſacrifice, for his name is glorified among the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Now (M. <hi>Watſon</hi>) let the Chriſtian Reader, weigh the words of <hi>Ireneus.</hi> And doe you weigh them better than you did, when you vſed them to proue that the Lords ſupper is the ſacrifice of the Church of Chriſt, and of our reconciliation. For <hi>Ireneus</hi> proueth that God delighteth in no outwarde ſacrifices, but doth by them teach what ſacrifice it is that he delighteth in. That is, faith,<note place="margin">Ireneus tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth what ſacrifice God delighteth in.</note> obedience, and iuſtice, which he would haue all men to offer, as a ſacrifice of thankeſgiuing to God for their ſaluation. And when Ieſus Chriſt did inſtitute his ſupper: he did thereby teach his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to offer that ſacrifice (as ye may learne in S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> his ſermon <hi>De ſacramentis fidelium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Citatur à Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da in Collect.</note>) and of the Apoſtles hath the church learned to offer the ſame in all partes of the worlde, which is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and pure ſacrifice, and the glorifying of the name of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Nations.</p>

What amendment of life wrought it in this Realme in Quéene Maries dayes?

You ſaye, it is an enimie and remedie againſt ſinne, and you take record of <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the holy Martir and witneſſe of Chriſt: but if he were liuing, he woulde giue you little thanke to take him to witneſſe in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt an vntruth. In déede <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaketh reuerentlye and trulye of the holy ſupper of the Lorde: for it is both a remedie to heale our infirmities, and a brent offering to purge our iniquities.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9612:13"/> and the malice of other, haue ſhot againſt it, that knowing the neceſsitie and goodneſſe of it, we may follow the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of S. Bernarde which ſayd, <hi>Diſcamus eius humilitatem,</hi>

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let vs learne his humillitie, let vs followe his meekeneſſe and gentleneſſe, let vs embrace his loue, let vs communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his paſsions by ſuffring with him, let vs bee waſhed in his bloud, let vs offer him the propitiation, or a ſacrifice propitiatorie for our ſinnes: for to this ende was he borne and giuen to vs: let vs offer hym to hys fathers eyes, let vs offer him to his owne eyes, for the father hath not ſpared his owne ſonne, but hath giuen him for vs, and ſo forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your purpoſe is (you ſay) in this ſermon to reduce into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of your Auditorie,<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> the foundation and commoditie of the Maſſe. (For that it is that you call the ſacrifice of the Church) and to repell the bolts. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As fooliſhe and malicious as you accompt them that haue ſhot boltes at your Blackbird the Maſſe: yet haue they beſtowed them ſo wiſely and charitably in the defence of the true Turtle Doue, the Church of Ieſus Chriſt, that you nor any of your ſort, neuer yet hath bene, or euer hereafter ſhall be, able to repell them, as you bragge that you minde to doe.</p>
            <p>As for your place of <hi>Bernarde:</hi> it might be aunſwered with this common ſaying: <hi>Bernardus non vidit omnia. <hi>Bernarde</hi>
               </hi> ſawe not all things, for his antiquitie is vnder fiue hundred yeares. So that it was a wonder that he ſaw any thing, the time wherein he liued being ſo ouerſhadowed with the cloudes of ignoraunce and ſuperſtition, and he himſelfe alſo being a Monke by profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Yet will I not ſo reiect him,<note place="margin">Bernard was the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his time.</note> bicauſe he was the flower of hys time, and ſéemeth by his writings to ſée more, than he durſt well vtter with his tongue or penne. And this ſentence that you cite
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9612:14"/> out of his Homilie, ſerueth not ſo much for your purpoſe, as you ſéeme to think that it doth. For what maner of ſpéeches are theſe? <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municemus paſsionibus, lauemur in ſanguine eius?</hi> Are they not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphores? For if we vſe theſe words in their proper ſignification, how is it poſſible for vs to doe the thing that <hi>Bernarde</hi> exhorteth vs to doe? Can we by any meanes ſuffer any part of that paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Chriſt ſuffered in his owne perſon? And is it poſſible for vs to bathe our bodies in his bloud? I thinke you be not ſo mad as once to thinke it. And why will you then ſnatch the next ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which is, <hi>Ipſum offeramus. &amp;c.</hi> Let vs offer him a ſacrifice propitiatorie for our ſinnes, for to that ende he was borne and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto vs, and vrge that as a proper ſpeach, where as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that to ſpeake properly, it cannot be true, that any eyther can or euer coulde, or euer ſhall be able to offer vp Chriſt to his father, but he himſelfe only.</p>
            <p>We therfore can offer Chriſt to his father none otherwiſe than we can bathe our ſelues in his bloude. That is, by beléeuing the promiſe that God the father hath made therein, and by receyuing the ſacrament Baptiſme,<note place="margin">Now we can offer Chriſt to his father.</note> the ſeale of that promiſe on Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, and of our faith on our behalfe. So can not we otherwiſe offer Chriſt to his father: than by beléeuing that he is that breade of life that came from heauen, and that gaue himſelfe for the life of the worlde, and by receiuing that ſacramentall breade and wine, which he commaunded to be receyued in remembraunce of his death and paſſion. Thus I truſt all indifferent men doe ſée how you doe wreſt the wordes of <hi>Bernarde,</hi> to make them ſerue your purpoſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And here the prayer was made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In many wordes immediatlye before theſe that you cite:<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> S. <hi>Bernarde</hi> prooueth, that our ſaluation commeth of the mercifull goodneſſe of God onely, and not of any thing that is in vs. For to that ende, he citeth the name <hi>Sauiour:</hi> both out of the wordes ſpoken by the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> to the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> and alſo out of the Aungels wordes to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and to the Shepheardes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring alſo the cauſe thereof to be, for that he ſhould ſaue his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their ſinnes.<note place="margin">To what vſe Watſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would haue Chriſt to ſerue.</note> But you (M. <hi>Watſon</hi>) would haue <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde</hi> to teache, that Chriſt ſerueth for none other purpoſe, but to be offered in the Maſſe, to helpe out with that, that lacketh in our merits.

               <hi>Now entring to ſpeake of the Sacrifice of the Church, I preſuppoſe one thing, which is the foundation of the ſame to be moſt certainly and conſtauntly beloued of all vs that be here preſent:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Here y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praier was made.</note> 
               <hi>which is, that in the moſt bleſſed ſacrament of the Aultare, is preſent the true bodye and bloud of our Sauiour Chriſt, the price of oure redemption, not in figure
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9612:15"/> onely, but in truth and very deede. Which the learned men call really, and eſſentially, that is to ſaye, that thing, that ſubſtance, that was vpon the Croſſe, is now verily preſent in the bleſſed Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before we receiue it: the cauſe of which reall preſence, is the omnipotent power &amp; will of God, aſsiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the due adminiſtration of the prieſt, the which body &amp; bloud we chriſten men receyue by the ſeruice of our bodies &amp; ſenſes, though not by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our ſenſes, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the iudgement of faith, bicauſe it is giuen, not in the outwarde forme of the ſelfe ſame body and bloud, as it was ſlaine &amp; ſhed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe: but in the formes of our daily and ſpecial nutriments of bread &amp; wine, and that for ſundry weighty &amp; neceſſary cauſes, foreſene by our ſauiour Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now you begin to builde,<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> and you preſuppoſe the foundation to be already layd in the minds of all your hearers, which is (as you ſay) that in the moſt bleſſed ſacrament of the Aultar, the true body and bloud of our Sauiour Chriſt is preſent, not in figure only. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Surely this foundation is not that, wheron S. <hi>Paule,</hi> that wiſe and good builder did build,<note place="margin">Watſon and Paule builde not both vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</note> then the which (as he ſayth) none can be laide, for chriſtians to build vpon. For Chriſt hath not taught that his Church ſhould offer ſuch a ſacrifice as you doe teach that your Sacrament is.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, although this foundation were layde in the harts of all your hearers: yet were it not ſure grounde to builde vpon, bicauſe it is beſide the Rock Chriſt. But I ſuppoſe, that your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were of thrée ſortes. One ſort I thinke, had your foundation hard rammed in their hartes, another ſort could not receyue any ſuch rubbiſhe into their harts,<note place="margin">Watſons hearers were of three ſorts.</note> as you doe vſe to ramme into your falſe foundation, but hauing alreadie receyued the Rock Chriſt, they cannot admit any other. But the thirde ſort, are lyke bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe quakemires, whereon no building can ſtande. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of your hearers haue ſince that time, when you made your Sermons: ſhewed themſelues to be ſuch. Wherefore your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſéemeth to me to be deceyued. But to your purpoſe. The reall and eſſentiall preſence of Chriſtes bodye and bloud in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9612:16"/> Sacrament, is the foundation of that you minde to teache in this Sermon.<note place="margin">The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſermon.</note> If I can proue then, that they be not ſo preſent therin: then muſt you ſéeke a new foundation to builde vppon. Which thing, by the helpe of God, I doubt not to doe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by reall and eſſentiall preſence, you meane ſuche a preſence, that who ſo receyueth into his body, the viſible Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: muſt of neceſſitie be confeſſed, to receyue the bodye and bloud of Chriſt alſo, euen into his bodye. But that is not true. <hi>Ergo. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> of this argument is your owne wordes, and the <hi>Minor</hi> muſt be prooued by Scriptures and Doctours, which is eaſie ynough to be done. Firſt our Sauiour Chriſt ſayth. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer entreth by the mouth,<note place="margin">

            <p>Our receyuing of Chriſt therfore, is ſpirituall into the ſoule by fayth: and into the body or by the ſenſes, ſacramentally, that is in ſuche ſort as by the receyuing of Sacramentes, we maye receyue the things ſignified by the ſame.

            <p>And further, we doe euen ſenſibly perceyue in Baptiſme, our buriall with Chriſt, to the worlde and worldly delightes: and our reſurrection with him to newneſſe of lyfe.

Theſe words neede no declaring but poynting: and for that cauſe why ſhould I tarie in this poynt any longer, ſeing that our Bookes be full of ſuch like authorities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore as I began ſeing the ſubſtaunce of our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the new Teſtament, is the very reall and naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, if this body be not preſent in the Sacrament as the enemies of Chriſtes Croſſe, and the deſtroyers of oure faith falſly pretende: then be wee chriſten men left altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſolate without anye Sacrifice priuate vnto vs, for both the Sacrifice of Chriſt vpon the croſſe, and alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9612:20"/> Sacrifice of mans heart be not priuate but common to vs, and to all faythfull men from the beginning of the worlde to the laſt ende.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe wordes are to proue,<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> that we (whome you call the enimies of Chriſts Croſſe and deſtroyers of your fayth) doe take awaye from the Church of Chriſt, that ſacrifice, that they maye and ought continually to offer to God: and leaue them in worſe caſe then were the Iewes or any other ſect, except the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> for they only are without a peculier ſacrifice to offer to their God. Your Argument, when the flowers of Rhetorick be taken from it: is in this forme. Seing that the ſubſtaunce of our ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is the verie reall and naturall body of Chriſt, they that denie it to be in ſuch ſort preſent, doe denie the Church to haue any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to offer to God: But the Proteſtantes doe denie it to be in ſuch ſortes preſent: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they denie the Church to haue any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to offer to God.</p>
            <p>To proue the <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition of this Argument:<note place="margin">Cyprian. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Ep <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> you make a long parentheſis. And firſt you begin with the wordes of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian. <hi>In ſacrificio quod Chriſtus eſt: non niſi Chriſtus ſequendus eſt.</hi>
               </hi> In that Sacrifice that is Chriſt: no man is to be folowed but Chriſt. True it is, that in the thirde Epiſtle of his ſeconde Booke: Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath thoſe wordes that you cite. But that he ment by thoſe wordes to affirme, that Chriſtes reall and naturall body is preſent in the ſacrament, I deny, and doubt not to be able to ſtand to that deniall, agaynſt all that can be iuſtly proued by the words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in that place or any other of his workes. And leaſt you ſhould think that of an obſtinacie, I doe without good ground denie that I am not able to aunſwere: I will ſhewe you what moueth me to denie that which you affirme.</p>

That the Cup which is offered in remembrance of him, be offered being mixed with Wine. For when Chriſt ſayth, I am a verie Vine, doubtleſſe then the bloud of Chriſt is not water, but Wine. Neyther can it ſéeme, that his bloud wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we were redéemed and quickened, is in the Cup: when it wanteth Wine, whereby Chriſts bloud is ſet forth and ſhewed, which is by the Sacrament and teſtimonie of all the Scriptures preached abroade.</p>

            <p>And after a few words, the ſame <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth thus. <hi>Vini vti<expan>

            <p>And in the ſame Epiſtle, after he hath ſpoken of the wordes of our Sauiour Chriſt, written in the <hi>.26.</hi> chapter of Saint <hi>Math.</hi> Goſpell: he ſayth. <hi>Qua in parte inuenimus, Calicem mixtum fuiſſe quem Dominus obtulit, &amp; vinum fu ſse quod ſanguinem ſuum dixit.</hi> In which part (ſayth <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ſpeaking of the Cup) we finde that the cup, which the Lorde offered, was mixed: and that the thing which he called his bloud, was Wyne.</p>
            <p>And againe, after he hath ſpoken of the words of the Apoſtle,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9612:21"/> he ſayth. <hi>Miror ſatis vnde hoc vſurpatum ſit: vt contra euangelicam &amp; apoſtolicam diſciplinam, quibuſdam in locis, aqua offeratur in dominico ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, quae ſola Chriſti ſanguinem non poſsit exprimere.</hi> I maruayle much (ſayth <hi>Cyprian</hi>) howe it commeth to paſſe, that contrarie to the doctrine both of the goſpell &amp; of the Apoſtle: water is in certayne places offered in the Lordes cup, which being but water alone, can not expreſſe the bloud of Chriſt.

And laſt of all, that water alone could not expreſſe the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>No man that is not blinded by affection, will ſaye, that <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> ment in that Epiſtle to teache, that Chriſtes reall and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body is preſent in the Sacrament, otherwiſe then ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and ſacramentally.

            <p>Such words, as theſe, are not for you to loke vpon.

            <p>Theſe wordes of Saint <hi>Auſten,</hi> doe make your definition ſcarce ſufficient, and the concluſion of your Argument nothing good. By your definition, euery ſuch outward proteſtation of our inwarde fayth and deuotion, as is made in the Maſſe, maye be a ſacrifice: and ſo euery Maſſe that is ſayd or ſong by a Prieſt, may be a ſacrifice.

            <p>But graunt that all Prieſtes were Aungels, and would ſay their Maſſes being moued thervnto by deuotion only: yet would not S. <hi>Auſten</hi> allowe their Maſſes for the ſacrifice of the Church. For he ſayth in the aforenamed booke.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Quoniam illud quod ab homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus appelatur ſacrificium, ſignum eſt veri ſacrificij.</hi> That thing that men doe call a ſacrifice, is the ſigne of the true ſacrifice. And that he meaneth this of that which you doe call the Maſſe: is manifeſt by his wordes in the later ende of the ſixt Chapiter of that booke, where he ſayth thus.<note place="margin">The Church is offered in hir owne ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> 
               <hi>Hoc eſt ſacrificium chriſtianorum, multi vnum corpus ſumus in Chriſto: quod etiam ſacramento altaris fidelibus noto, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent at Eccleſia, vbi ei demonſtratur, quod in ea oblatione quam offert, ipſa offertur.</hi> This (ſayth Saint <hi>Auſten,</hi> ſpeaking of the offering vp of our ſelues a ſacrifice to God) is the ſacrifice of the Chriſtians, we being many, are one body in Chriſt: which the congregation alſo doth frequent in the ſacrament of the Altare, which is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the faythfull: Where it is playnely ſhewed vnto hir, that ſhe hir ſelfe is in that oblation offered.</p>
            <p>The meaning of this maner of ſpéeche that ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> vſeth here: was well knowne among Chriſtians in his dayes. But in later times it hath growne out of knowledge, and therfore we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9612:28"/> had néede nowe to ſaye ſomething of it: leaſt you and your ſort ſhould begin to triumph ouer vs, and ſaye, that nowe we haue found a ſacrament of the altare, which ſome of vs haue denied to be. I my ſelfe haue denied, and doe ſtill denie, that there is anye ſuch ſacrament of the altare, as the Popes Church doth at thys daye frequent and vſe, wherein the Prieſt alone doth make a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the quick and dead: but that there is ſuche a ſacrament of the altare, as ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> ſpeaketh of here, that is, wherein Chriſtians doe offer vp themſelues to God, a ſacrifice of thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuing,<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altare.</note> and doe exerciſe the workes of mercy towards them that ſtande in néede, and therefore called it in the Gréeke tongue <hi>Euchariſtia</hi> and <hi>Agape,</hi> thankeſgyuing, and loue: I neyther haue done, nor doe denie.</p>
            <p>And bicauſe the fathers knewe, that this ſacrifice could not be acceptable to God, except it were offered vpon Chriſt, their Altare: they called the ſacrament, whereby they vſed chiefely to ſhewe themſelues to be nothing elſe but a ſacrifice to be offered to God, the ſacrament of the altare, meaning by that altare Chriſt, wherevpon they offered themſelues a Sacrifice acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. But ſuche a ſacrament as the Papiſtes doe hang ouer their altare, and ſuche an altare as they vſe to ſaye Maſſe vpon: we knowe not of, neyther did the fathers knowe any ſuche. And this may ſuffiſe for the diſproofe of your definition of a ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Nowe ſomething muſt be ſayde, concerning that place of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> which you cite. In déede ſaint <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth in ſuch words as you cite, reproue the groſſe opinion of the <hi>Capernaits:</hi> who ſuppoſed that our Sauiour had ſpoken of the outward and fleſhly eating of that body of his, which was preſent in their ſight. And therefore he ſayth, <hi>Cum illius perſonae caro &amp;c.</hi> as you haue cited.</p>
            <p>But here (M. <hi>Watſon</hi>) I muſt tell you, that you deale not faythfully in cyting of the words of this father. For in the words next folowing, he ſayth thus. <hi>Sed in cogitationibus huiuſmodi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cyprian. Sermone. De Caena.</note> 
               <hi>caro &amp; ſanguis non prodeſt quicquam. &amp;c.</hi> But in ſuch maner of thoughts (ſayth <hi>Cyprian</hi>) fleſhe and bloud doe not helpe any thing at all. For as the maiſter himſelfe hath declared: theſe wordes are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and lyfe, neyther doth the fleſhly ſenſe, enter in vnto the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9612:29"/> of ſo great a déepeneſſe, except there come faith ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. The breade is meate, the bloud is lyfe, the fleſhe is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, the body is the Church. A body, bicauſe of the agréeing of the members in one: bread, bicauſe of the congruence of the nouriſhment. Bloud, bicauſe of the working of lyuelyneſſe. Fleſh, bicauſe of the propertie of the humane nature, that he hath taken vpon him. Chriſt doth ſometime call this ſacrament his owne bodie, ſometime his fleſhe and bloud, ſometimes bread, a portion of euerlaſting life, whereof he hath according to theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thinges, giuen part to the corporall nature. This common foode being chaunged into fleſhe and bloud, doth procure lyfe and encreaſing vnto bodies, and therefore, the weakeneſſe of oure fayth, being holpen by the accuſtomed effect of things, is by a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible argument taught, that the effect of eternall lyfe is in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſacramentes, and that we are made one with Chriſt, not ſo much by a bodily paſſing into him, as by a ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>And agayne, in the ſame Sermon, he ſayth. <hi>Eſus igitur carnis huius, quaedam auiditas eſt, &amp; quoddam deſiderium manendi in ipſo. &amp;c.</hi> The eating therefore of this fleſhe, is a certaine gréedineſſe and deſire to dwell in him, whereby we doe ſo preſſe and melt in our ſelues the ſwéeteneſſe of loue: that the taſte of loue that is poured into vs, may cleaue in the roofe of our mouth and bowels, ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into and making moyſt all the corners, both of our ſoules and body. Drinking and eating, doe appertayne both to one reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And as the bodily ſubſtaunce is nouriſhed by them, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and contynueth in health: ſo the lyfe of the ſpirite is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with thys foode, that doth properly belong thereto. And looke what foode is to the fleſhe: the ſame is fayth to the ſoule. Looke what thing meat is to the bodye: the ſame is the worde to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, with more excellent power performing euerlaſtingly, the thing that fleſhely nouriſhments doe worke temporally and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Hitherto <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it had pleaſed you, to haue weighed all theſe wordes of <hi>Cyprian:</hi> I thinke you could not for ſhame, haue wreſted his former wordes, to ſuch purpoſe as you doe, concluding that if we haue not Chriſtes body and bloud in the ſacrament for our exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9612:29"/> ſacrifice, whereby we may mitigate. &amp;c. then we ſhould be no better then Turkes. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelfe, doth in theſe words that I haue cited out of the ſame Sermon: expound his meaning in the former wordes cyted by you, to be farre other, then that which you ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and conclude vpon them.</p>
            <p>In déede, if the <hi>Capernaits</hi> had deuoured the body of Chriſt, and none could haue bene ſaued, but ſuch as had bene partakers of the ſame with them: a very ſmall number ſhould haue bene ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him. And when that number had bene dead: his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt néedes haue bene at an ende, for they ſhould haue had no more ſacrifice for ſinne, for as much as he which ſhould be the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſacrifice for ſinne, had bene by them eaten vp and conſumed.</p>
            <p>When ſaint <hi>Cyprian</hi> therfore, had thus ſpoken of the groſſe opinion of the <hi>Capernaits:</hi> he doth immediatly adde theſe words. <hi>Sed in cogitationibus. &amp;c.</hi> But in ſuch maner of cogitations: fleſhe and bloud doe profite nothing at all. For as the maiſter himſelfe hath taught: theſe wordes are ſpirite and lyfe. &amp;c. And agayne, afterward he ſayth, <hi>Eſus igitur carnis huius. &amp;c.</hi> The eating of this fleſhe therefore, is a certaine gréedineſſe and deſire, to abide or dwell in him. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt therfore, that ſaint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ment not to teach,<note place="margin">Cyprians meaning.</note> that vnleſſe the body of Chriſt, be really and ſubſtantially preſent in the ſacrament, the Church can haue no ſacrifice, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no religion: but his meaning was to teache, that it was not a fleſhely: but a ſpirituall eating that he ſpake of. And that by faith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church hath Chriſt her euerlaſting ſacrifice for ſinne, not offered by the maſſing Prieſtes euerye daye: but offered by himſelfe once for all, and yet ſtill preſent with God as all things (both paſt and to come) are. For with God there is neyther time paſt, nor to come: but all preſent.</p>
            <p>Other ſacrifice to mitigate or pleaſe God: the Church ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath nor néedeth anye. For Chriſt hath by that one ſacrifice once offered, made perfite as manye as be made holye, that is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.</note> as many as be ſanctified by the holy ſpirite of adoption.</p>
            <p>And where as you compare vs to the Turkes, as hauing no

               <hi>There be three things that holde mee in this faith: the manifeſt and plaine ſcripture, the vniforme aucthorities of holy men, and the conſent of the vniuerſall Church.

And for that reaſon we muſt conſider that it is otherwiſe with Chriſt, then with vs, for in man the worde is true, when the thing is true, whereof it is ſpoken: In God the thing is true when the worde is ſpoken of the thing.

            </p>

For in the ſame Chapiter, not twentie lynes before thoſe wordes that you cite: <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſayth thus. <hi>Igitur, non ſacrificiae ſanctificant hominem, non enim indiget ſacrificio Deus: ſed conſcientiae
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9612:35"/> eius qui offert ſanctificat ſacrificium, pura exiſtens, &amp; praeſtat accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare Deum, quaſi ab amico.</hi> The ſacrifices doe not make the man that doth offer them, holye (for God hath no néede of Sacrifice) but the conſcience of him that offereth, being pure: doth make the ſacrifice holye, and cauſeth God to take it in good part, as at the hande of a friend.</p>
            <p>And agayne he ſayth. <hi>Oportet enim nos oblationem Deo facere. &amp;c.</hi> We muſt needes make an oblation to God: and be found thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God our maker in all things. In pure iudgement, in faith without Hipocriſie, in firme hope, in feruent loue, offering vp the firſt fruites of thoſe thinges which are his creatures. And the Church only may offer this pure oblation to hir maker, offering vnto him, ſome part of his creature, with thankeſgyuing vnto him. But the Iewes doe not now offer, for their handes be full of bloud: for they haue not receyued the worde, whereby offering is made to God. No more doe all the Synagogs of heretikes. And other which ſaye that there is another father, beſides him that is the maker: doe therefore when they offer to him, thoſe thinges that be of the ſame creation that we are: declare thereby, that he is deſirous of that which is not his owne, and coueteth after thoſe things that appertayne to other. And ſuch as doe ſaye, that the things which are of the ſame creation with vs, be made by defect and ignoraunce and ſuffering: doe when they offer the fruites of ignoraunce and of ſuffering and defect, ſinne againſt their father, reuiling him rather then giuing him thankes.</p>
            <p>After theſe wordes, doe thoſe wordes followe that you haue cited for your purpoſe. <hi>Quomodo autem conſtabit eis. &amp;c.</hi> Howe ſhall it be certaine vnto them, that, that bread, wherein thankes are giuen, is the body of their Lorde, and the Cup of his bloud, if they ſay not that he is the ſonne of him that is the maker of the world? Thus farre go the wordes that you cite. And where as you ſhut vp the matter with an interrogation, as though there were the whole of that which the Author doth there wryte of this matter: in as many Copies as I haue ſéene, the poynt there is but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, and the ſentence contynued with theſe wordes, <hi>id eſt, verbum eius, per quod lignum fructificat. &amp;c.</hi> That is, his wordes, whereby
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9612:35"/> the trée is made fruitfull, &amp; the Fountaynes to flowe, that gyueth firſt the blade, then the eare, and then the full corne in the eare? And agayne, how doe they ſaye that the fleſhe which is nouriſhed with the body and bloud of the Lorde, doth come into corruption, and not receyue lyfe? Therefore eyther let them chaunge their minde, or abſtayne from offering the things that are ſpoken of before. As for our iudgement, it is agréeable to the <hi>Euchariſte</hi> or thankeſgyuing: and on the contrarie part, the <hi>Euchariſte,</hi> doth confirme our ſentence or iudgement. For we doe offer vnto him the things that are his, and doe agréeably preach the communion and vnitie of the fleſhe and the ſpirite. For euen as the breade which is of the earth, taking the name of God, is not nowe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread, but the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> (or ſacrament of thankeſgyuing) conſiſting of two things, one earthly and another heauenly: ſo our bodies alſo, being made partakers of the <hi>Euchariſte,</hi> are not nowe corruptible, for as much as they haue the hope of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And agayne in the ende of the Chapter he ſayth. <hi>Sic &amp; idio nos quo<expan>

For thither are all oure pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and oblations directed: and our temple, euen as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth in his reuelations: And the Temple of God and tabernacle was ſet open.</p>

The ſacrifice (ſayth he) is ſanctified by the pure conſcience of the offerer. We muſt be founde thankefull to our maker in all things: in pure iudgement, in vnfayned fayth, in ſtedfaſt hope, and in feruent loue, offring to him the firſt fruits of thoſe things that be his creatures. And the Church onely may offer this oblation. The bread which is of the earth receyuing the name of God, is not now common bread: but the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of two things the one earthly, and the other heauenly. He

            <p>How doe theſe words agrée with the reall preſence of Chriſt in the ſacrament? And howe can theſe wordes ſuffer your Maſſe to be accompted the ſacrifice of the Church? The whole purpoſe of <hi>Ireneus</hi> in that Chapiter, is to ſhewe, that the workes of loue procéeding from an vnfayned fayth, and a pure conſcience: are that ſacrifice that God regardeth. And in the vſe of the ſacrament which he calleth the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> or thankeſgiuing: this ſacrifice ſo acceptable to God, is not onely taught by ſenſible ſignes, but alſo exerciſed. And the aultar whereon this ſacrifice is offered, is Chriſt, which is in heauen.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Againſt whome Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus did write.</note>The wordes that you cite, were by <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſpoken againſt ſuch as affirmed that God is not the maker of thoſe creatures that we haue the vſe of.

               <note place="margin">WATSON. Diuiſion. 15.</note> 
               <hi>was to conſider to what purpoſe and intent Chriſt ſpake thoſe wordes, and I ſayde they were wordes not of a bare narration, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome doctrine, but the wordes of the inſtitution of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the new Teſtament. And then it followeth, that if they be the forme of a ſacrament as they be in dede: then muſt they needes be that inſtrument wherby Gods almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power aſſiſting the due miniſtration of his Prieſt, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that grace inwardly, that the words purport outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

            <p>
               <hi>Nowe to oure purpoſe: The grace which is included in theſe wordes, this is my body, this is my bloud, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accidentall grace as in the other, but the body of Chriſt

His purpoſe was not (ſaye you) by theſe words to ſhewe what the thing was that he ſpake of: but to vſe the words as an inſtrument whereby the inwarde thing ſignified by the outwarde wordes is wrought. And to make this your opinion playne: you vſe the wordes in Baptiſme, in Penaunce, and the contract in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for examples.</p>
            <p>Surely (M. <hi>Watſon</hi>) this muſt néedes appéere a ſtraunge maner of doctrine, when it ſhall be waighed by them that doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the vſe of wordes is, and what the almightie power of God is. Learned men haue alwayes taught, that the vſe of wordes is to teach the hearers: and that they be inſtruments ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing onely to that vſe. None but Sorcerers wyll ſay that words are inſtrumentes to worke wonders with. In déede, the Poete ſpeaking of magicall verſes, ſayth thus. <hi>Carmina vel caelo, poſſunt deducere lunam.</hi> Verſes are of ſuch force that they are able to bring

            <p>Peraduenture you will ſaye, that the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> will take your part, bicauſe he ſayth. <hi>Verbo Domini caeli firmati ſunt:</hi>
               <note place="margin">

So that his wordes are this much to ſay. In the ſonne and the holy Ghoſt: hath the Lorde, which is but one diuine power, eſtabliſhed the heauens. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The power of God is ſuch, that at his worde, beck, or twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his eye: he is able to doe what he will doe. According to the wordes of the ſame prophet in another Pſalme. <hi>Deus noſter in caelo, omnia quaecun<expan>

            <p>I conclude therefore, that it is the power of God, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all in all. And that the worde formed is no inſtrument to worke by, otherwiſe then in teaching. And therefore, your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be euill fauouredly applied.</p>

But it ſhould haue bene much more for your honeſty, being father of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> act when they procéeded: to haue inſtructed them ſo before hand, that they might haue béene able to ſpeake congrue latine.

After this ſort the Lorde therefore drawing néere vnto his paſſion, did of his owne frée mercy, prouide to inueſt thoſe that appartayned vnto him, that the inuiſible grace, might by ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſigne be ſet forth and ſhewed.

               <note place="margin">WATSON. Diuiſion. 16</note> 
               <hi>be the performaunce of a former promiſe, where Chriſt (as it is written in the ſixt Chapiter of S. Iohn) promiſed to giue vs the ſame fleſhe to eate, that he would giue to the death, for the lyfe of the worlde ſaying. <hi>Panis quem ego dabo, caro mea eſt,</hi>

               <hi>Which promiſe, we neuer read, that Chriſt (which is the very truth &amp; can not lye) did euer at any time performe, but in his laſt ſupper, when he gaue his bodye and bloud to his Diſciples: and to promiſe his fleſhe, and to giue bare bread and not his fleſhe, is no performing, but a breaking of his promiſe, and a deluding of them to whome he made the promiſe. For as for the interpretation, which ſome men make of Chriſtes words, that he will giue his fleſhe to vs to be eaten ſpiritually by faith: is but a vaine and fained gloſe for that text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And although Chriſt doe ſo giue it to be eaten by faith: yet we maye not exclude one truth by another truth as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters doe.

But after what maner, he will giue his owne fleſhe to be eaten, he doth not declare: bicauſe they could not vnderſtande it. But howe great good things they ſhall obtayne, if they ſhall with faith eate it: he doth oftentimes declare, that by the deſire of eternall lyfe, they might be compelled to imbrace fayth, by the meane wherof, they might the more eaſily be taught.

            <p>Nowe let the indifferent Reader iudge howe faythfully you haue handled the wordes of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and ſo he may haue the leſſe cauſe to credite you in your large affirmation, wherein you ſaye,<note place="margin">Watſons ſtore is but ſmall.</note> that all the good auncient Writers doe with one conſent, expound this place of <hi>Iohn</hi> as you doe.

            <p>Wherfore, we may well conclude, that Chriſtes fleſhe is not in the ſacrament in ſuch ſort as ye teach: and that Chriſt ment not by thoſe wordes that you cite out of <hi>Iohn,</hi> to promiſe, that he would giue his bodye in ſuch ſort to be eaten, as ye haue affirmed that he did.

And that not to be eaten after a fleſhly ſort, but after ſuch a ſpirituall ſort, as the fathers that lyued afore he was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, had and did eate it.

Well. If we ſhall haue occaſion hereafter, to charge you with theſe words: we will vrge them with ſuch force, that ſo ſlender an aunſwere ſhall not ſerue you.</p>
            <p>But in the meane while you dalley with thoſe figuratiue ſpéeches that are vſed in the ſcriptures. I am the way, I am the dore, I am the Vine, I am the lyght. A generall rule may be (ſay you) obſerued: that when Chriſt ſpeaketh of himſelfe by the name of anye creature, there muſt be a better thing vnderſtande, then the thing is, that ſuch a name doth properly ſignifie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt in the matter of the ſacrament, vnderſtand a better and more excellent thing, then is Bread and Wine.</p>
            <p>Me thinketh (M. <hi>Watſon</hi>) you might haue ſpared all this labour. For none of vs hath or doth denie, that when Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9612:41"/> of himſelfe, and gyueth himſelfe the name of any creature: we muſt vnderſtande a better thing, then is properly ſignified by that name. But what maketh this for your purpoſe? It ſéemeth to me, that eyther you your ſelfe haue forgotten your Logick: or elſe when you did ſet forth your Sermon in print, you thought that the worlde would neuer turne ſo, that any Logition might be bolde in open wryting to controule your ſubtile ſophiſtrie.</p>
            <p>When I was Logitioner in Oxford: I learned, that in euery <hi>Cathegoricall</hi> propoſition, there be <hi>Tres termini. Subiectum, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatum, &amp; Copula.</hi> Nowe the <hi>Subiectum,</hi> is that, whereof af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation or negation is made: and <hi>Predicatum</hi> is that, which is affirmed or denied. And <hi>Copula</hi> is the verbe Subſtantiue, that in conſtruction ſtandeth betwixt them.</p>
            <p>You muſt not be offended with me,<note place="margin">Watſons ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtrie hath made him forget his Logick.</note> for that I talke with you of things ſo farre vnder the profeſſion of a Doctour of Diuinitie: for ſurely you ſéeme to me to haue forgotten all, ſeing you ſhame not to ſaye, that Chriſt ſpeaketh here of himſelfe, as in the other places that you cite for example. I am the Vine, and this is my body: haue both one <hi>Subiectum,</hi> by your ſophiſtry. If Chriſt had ſayde I am bread, as in the ſixt of <hi>Iohn</hi> he ſayde, I am that bread which came downe from heauen: then your rule would haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But ſith he ſayth, this is my bodye: it is manifeſt, that he ſpeaketh of the bread and ſayth that it is his body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mathew, Marke, Luke, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Paule,</hi> be no more on your ſide then they be on oures. But rather their playne words doe prooue, that you for your reaſoning without probabilitie, and contrarie to the rule of all true reaſoning,<note place="margin">Watſon muſt be promoted.</note> are méete to be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Hall into the Kitchin, or rather from the Diuinitie Schoole to the Logick lecture. For they all with one conſent ſay, that our ſauiour Chriſt ſpake not of himſelfe, but of the bread af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it to be his body and his fleſhe. Which we doe not denie, affirming the contradictorie (as you ſay that we doe) but we doe moſt conſtauntly affirme that to be true which Chriſt both ſpake and ment. That is, that in the ſacrament, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread is his body,<note place="margin">Watſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth Chriſts words to be true.</note> and the wine his bloud. But you and your ſort do denie his words to be true, &amp; do affirme the contradictory: for you ſay there is neither bread nor wine remayning in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. So that when Chriſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9612:42"/> tooke bread in his hande, and ſpeaking of the bread ſayde, this is my body: the bread was not his body (by your doctrine) but his body was there vnder the accidents of bread, and the ſubſtaunce of the bread (as ſome of you ſaye) turned into the body of Chriſt: or as ſome other teache, the ſubſtaunce of the bread being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed away: the ſubſtaunce of Chriſts body commeth in place vnder the accidents of that bread that was there. Theſe be fond and falſe gloſes, neyther true nor lykely, nor yet tollerable.

Nowe, if yea and naye, may be contrarie: then is there contradiction in your wordes. But to the matter. There is no promiſe of grace, made in the ſcripture, to the worthy receyuer of bread and wine: Wherefore, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that bread and wine can be no ſacrament. The ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might be made againſt that which you haue ſaide of baptiſme. For as I haue declared before: there is no promiſe of grace made in the ſcriptures, to the waſhing in water alone: but the promiſe is made to the beléeuer, which beléeuing, will be baptiſed. Thoſe therefore that did put to that part of the definition of a ſacrament, did not minde thereby to ſhewe the difference betwéene the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the olde and new Teſtament: but to ſignifie, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith in the promiſe made in Chriſt, it ſhould not auayle to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue any ſacrament. Faith therefore is it, that hath the promiſe of grace annexed vnto it.</p>
            <p>You haue ſayde, that if we would looke in the ſixt Chapter of ſaint Iohns Goſpell, we ſhould finde, that the promiſe of the myſticall vnitie that is amongſt chriſtians, is not made to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing of bread &amp; wine: but to the worthy receyuing of Chriſts body and bloud. We haue looked there, and haue found it euen ſo. And we haue founde alſo, that the worthy receyuing of the bodye and bloud of Chriſt: is the receyuing of it in fayth. For Chriſt ſayth there. <hi>Amen amen dico vobis, qui credit in me, habet vitam aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</hi> He that beléeueth in me, hath euerlaſting lyfe. And againe. <hi>Sicut miſit me viuens Pater, &amp; ego viuo propter patrem: &amp; qui mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat me, &amp; ipſe viuet propter me.</hi> Euen as the lyuing father hath ſent me, and I doe lyue through the father: ſo he that eateth me, the ſame ſhall alſo liue by the meanes of me.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9612:44"/> to eate the lyuing bread. And in the ſame treatiſe, ſpeaking of the viſible ſacrament: he ſayth thus. <hi>Nam &amp; nos hodie accepimus viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem cibum: ſed aliud eſt ſacramentum, aliud eſt virtus ſacramenti.</hi> For we alſo, haue this day receiued viſible foode: but the ſacrament is one thing, and the vertue and ſtrength of the ſacrament, is another thing. And againe. <hi>Hic eſt ergo panis qui de coelo deſcendit: vt ſi quis manducauerit ex ipſo, non moriatur. Sed quod pertinet ad vim ſacramenti, non quod pertinet ad viſibile ſacramentum. Qui manducat intus, non foris: Qui manducat in corde, non qui premit dente.</hi> This is therefore the bread that came downe from heauen: that if any man ſhould eate thereof, the ſame might not die. But yet that which appertayneth to the vertue and force of the ſacrament: not that which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the viſible ſacrament. He that eateth within, not without. He that eateth in his hart: not he that cruſheth it with his téeth. And agayne he ſayth. <hi>Hoc eſt ergo manducare illam eſcam, &amp; illum bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere potum: in Chriſto manere, &amp; illum manentem in ſe habere.

And by this meanes, he that dwelleth not in Chriſt, and in whome Chriſt dwelleth not: without doubt, he doth neyther eate his fleſh nor drinke his bloud ſpiritually: although he doe fleſhly and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cruſhe with his téeth, the ſacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt, but he doth rather eate and drinke the ſacrament of ſo great a thing, to his owne condemnation.</p>
            <p>Here appéereth playnely the iudgement of ſaint <hi>Auſten,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the outwarde and viſible ſacrament: and alſo touching the inward thing, ſignified by the outward ſigne.

            <p>As many as wyll, may by theſe wordes vnderſtande, what Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> ment by thoſe wordes that go before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon you would conclude, that the ſacrament (which you terme the ſacrament of the aultar) is not Wine, but bloud.

His meaning was (as it maye be iuſtly gathered of his wordes) to teach that our ſacramentes take their worthyneſſe of none other thing, then the worthyneſſe of the death and bloudſheding of our Sauiour Chriſt, and that the infirmitie of oure nature in Chriſt, is become our ſtrength in him.</p>
            <p>It ſéemeth to me a ſtraunge maner of reaſoning that you vſe, when you ſaye, that for as much as there came no wine out of Chriſts ſide: therefore, our ſacrament is not wine, but Chriſtes bloud. If you will giue me leaue to reaſon after that ſort: I will proue yet once againe, that the Church hath but two ſacraments. For ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> ſayth, that the ſacraments of the Church did flowe out of Chriſtes ſide, and you ſay, two ſacraments did flowe out of his ſide, that is to ſaye, water and bloud.

In the olde, the prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our poſſeſſion is knowne: and in the newe, the poſſeſſion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9612:49"/> it ſelfe is enioyed. We therefore, that be chriſten men of the new Teſtament, be not vnder figures, as were the Iewes: but we are in poſſeſſion of the thing ſignified by the figures of the olde Teſtament. And yet we may be bolde to ſaye, that we haue the ſignes or figures of the body and bloud of our ſauiour Chriſt, to put vs in remembraunce of that poſſeſſion, and doe not doubt to call the ſame by the name of the things ſignified, as ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> wryteth againſt the ſame <hi>Adimantus. <hi>Non enim Dominus dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit dicere, hoc eſt corpus meum: cum ſignum daret corporis ſui.</hi>

                  <hi>Capit.</hi> 12.</note> The Lord doubted not to ſay, this is my body: when he delyuered the ſigne of his body.</p>
            <p>We holde therefore, that the confirmation of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the newe both: is the othe that God made vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his faythfull ſéede. And that the thing promiſed, was prefigured by the figures of the olde law. And that the ſame is playnely repreſented and ſet forth before our ſenſes, by thoſe figures that our Sauiour hath inſtituted: not as a thing to come, but as a thing alreadie had in poſſeſſion, and not to be forgotten of ſuch as haue receyued it. We therefore are not vnder figures, as were the Iewes, before the ſhedding of Chriſts bloud: but we doe vſe thoſe figures that Chriſt himſelfe hath inſtituted, to ſuch purpoſe as he did inſtitute them for. Neyther doe we ſay or thinke that they be but bare bread and wine: but we teach, that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receyuer is by them aſſured, euen as it were ſenſibly, that he is made one with Chriſt and Chriſt with him, that he dwelleth in Chriſt and Chriſt in him, that he receiueth into his ſoule whole Chriſt,<note place="margin">We teach not that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is but bare bread and wine.</note> euen as he receyueth the ſacramentall bread and wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his body.

            <p>I conclude therefore thus. The othe which God ſwore to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> is the confirmation of the olde and newe Teſtament: <hi>Ergo,</hi> neyther was the olde confirmed by the bloud of Calues and Goates, neyther the new by the ſacrament of Chriſtes bloud.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:9612:50"/> And ſo conſequently, it is not any inconuenience at all, to holde that the ſubſtaunce of bread and wine doth ſtill remayne in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Yet one other thing I muſt néedes note, that in all this adoe, that you make about this effect of the ſacrament: you ſpeake not one worde of the fleſhe of Chriſt, but altogither of his bloud: Theſe wordes, This is my bloud, muſt be the forme of our ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. &amp;c.

               <hi>Another effect of this ſacrament is taught vs in S. Luke, the 24. Chapter of his Goſpell. Where our Sauiour Chriſt ſate downe with his two Diſciples that went to Emaus, and taking bread, bleſſed it and brake it, and gaue it to them. And then their eyes were opened,</hi>

The vnitie whereof the Apoſtle doth ſet forth in the ſacrament of bread, ſaying, we being manye, are but one bread and one bodye: that when he ſhould giue vnto them the bleſſed bread, their eyes might be opened and they know him. That they might be opened to know him: the let whereby they were holden that they ſhould not know him being taken away. For they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

            <p>As for the wordes that you cite out of <hi>Theophilacte:</hi> doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make againſt you then with you.

Another thing alſo is giuen vs to vnderſtande: that is: that the eyes of them that doe receyue the bleſſed bread are opened, that they might know him. For the fleſhe of the Lord hath an vnſpeakable power. For it vaniſhed out of their ſight: neither had he ſtil ſuch a body, as might be much conuerſant with them after a bodily maner, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thereby their deſire might encreaſe.</p>
            <p>When theſe wordes be well weighed and conſidered togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: they doe rather teache vs, that the power of Chriſts fleſhe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9612:51"/> is vnſpeakable in vaniſhing out of the Diſciples ſight, then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening their eyes. For he ſayth not, that the eyes of them that did receyue his fleſhe, were opened that they might knowe him: but the eyes of them that did receyue that bread, where ouer he gaue thankes (which he calleth bleſſed bread) were opened to knowe him. Howe can you then prooue by this place: that in the ſacrament of Chriſtes bodye and bloud, there is neyther bread nor wine.</p>
            <p>Your concluſion therefore is to large, when you ſaye,<note place="margin">To large a concluſion.</note> that thereby men may ſée, that the opening of our eyes to ſée God: is one of the effectes of the ſacrament that you talke of.

            </p>
            <p>In the proouing of this effect of your ſacrament:<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> you deale as faythfully as you haue done in the reſt. Firſt, how faythfully doe you deale, in cyting the words of our ſauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Watſon will not leaue his olde wont.</note> in the ſixt of Iohn, as ment of the ſacramentall eating of his fleſhe, whereas the circumſtaunce of the text will not ſuffer any ſuch ſenſe? For if he ſhould meane there, of the ſacramentall eating of his fleſhe and drinking of his bloud: then could none be ſaued but ſuch only as doe ſo eate and drinke the ſame. And contrariewiſe, none that doe ſo eate and drinke them, could periſhe. For he ſayth, he that eateth my fleſhe and drinketh my bloud: hath euerlaſting lyfe. It is manifeſt therefore that theſe wordes of Chriſt, be ſpoken of the ſpirituall eating and drinking of his fleſh and bloud, and not of a ſacramental eating or drinking. For the ſacrament was not then inſtituted neyther did our Sauiour Chriſt, go about to inſtitute a ſacrament of his body and bloud at that time.</p>
            <p>But in cyting the wordes of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> in the fiftene chapter of his fourth booke: your faithfull dealing is moſt manifeſt. If you had cyted <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his wordes wholy as they ſtande in his booke: they would haue made to much againſt you. And therfore, when you had ſayde. <hi>Ego enim dixit (id eſt corpus meum quod comedetur) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitabo eum:</hi> Chriſt ſayde, I (that is to ſaye, my body that ſhall be eaten) will raiſe him vp: then you paſſe ouer the wordes that folowe, which are theſe. <hi>Non enim alius ipſe eſt quam caro ſua. Non id dico quia natura non ſit alius: ſed quia poſt incarnationem, in duos diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di filios minime patitur.</hi> For he is not any other then the ſame which his fleſh is. I ſpeake not this bicauſe he is not another in nature: but bicauſe after his incarnation, he doth not ſuffer himſelfe to be deuided into two ſonnes. All theſe words you doe ſlylie paſſe ouer:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9612:53"/> bicauſe the meaning of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> in the other wordes, which you cite, is made playne by theſe. And then you cite the wordes that folowe. <hi>Ego igitur &amp;c.</hi> But you go not ſo farre as you ſhould. For <hi>Cyrillus</hi> ſayth this much more, in the wordes immediatly folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Nempe impoſsibile omninò eſt, ne in territus &amp; mors, ab eo qui natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter vita eſt ſuperetur: propterea, quamuis mors, quae propter peccatum noſtrum in naturam noſtram inſilijt, corpus humanum ad corruptionem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellat, tamen, quia filius Dei homo factus eſt, omnes profectò reſurgemus. Non enim poteſt natura noſtra vitae coniuncta non viuiſicari.</hi> For it is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible, that deſtruction and death ſhould not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him, which naturally is lyfe: wherefore although death, which for our ſinnes hath ſkipt into our nature, doe driue mans body to corruption: yet bicauſe the ſonne of God is made man, we ſhall all ſurely riſe agayne. For it is not poſſible that our nature which is ioyned to lyfe,<note place="margin">Chriſtes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation is the cauſe of our reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> ſhould not be quickned. Here it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that not the eating, and drinking of Chriſtes body and bloud ſacramentally, but the incarnation of Chriſt, is the cauſe of our reſurrection as <hi>Cyrillus</hi> thinketh.</p>
            <p>But you haue yet another place of <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> where he ſayth. <hi>Recordare. &amp;c.</hi> You haue a maruellous grace in leauing out that, which ſhould make againſt your purpoſe. But this foly I doe note in you, that you can not beware of cyting matter for your purpoſe, which in the places that you cite, is beſet with matter againſt you, as though you were aſſured that no man had thoſe bookes but you, or that no man would take paynes to waigh thoſe places, or were able to eſpie your ſlights.

Nec velis Iudaice quomodo quaerere: ſed recordare. &amp;c.</hi> He did not therefore alwayes (as we haue ſayde) rayſe vp the dead with a worde onely, but with a touche alſo, to declare that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alſo was able to giue lyfe. And if thinges corrupted be made
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9612:53"/> ſounde againe by touching alone: how ſhould we, which doe both taſte and eate that fleſh, be without lyfe? For it will reforme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the immortalitie that is in it ſelfe: thoſe that be partakers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Neyther be thou wylling, after the maner of the Iewes, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how: but remember. &amp;c. as you haue cited afore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrillus</hi> doth here go about to proue, that there was power in the body of Chriſt, to make ſounde thoſe corrupted things that he did but touch. And that therefore ſuch as doe taſt and eate the fleſhe of that body, muſt néedes be quickned therby. But how doth this proue, that the ſacrament of Chriſtes body and bloud, being eaten: is the cauſe of reſurrection and euerlaſting lyfe to the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? By your vnderſtanding of <hi>Cyrillus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſequele of Watſons doctrine.</note> his doctrine muſt teache vs, that if the Capernaits had layde handes on Chriſt and eaten him vp euerye morſell, they had done verie well and wiſely: for ſo they ſhould haue bene ſure of euerlaſting lyfe. But farre was that learned father from ſo vnlearned a meaning: as may well appéere, euen in the wordes that you cite. For in vſing the ſimilitude of water made whot by fyre: he ſheweth what life it is, that doth quicken vs into euerlaſting lyfe. Euen that lyfe, which is Chriſt God and man, which commeth vnto vs by faith, and maketh vs forget our coldneſſe of infidelitie and lack of loue, and doth heat vs with moſt conſtaunt faith, made fruitful by loue. And ſo we doe profitably eate the fleſhe and drinke the bloud of Chriſt, for we dwell in Chriſt, and haue him dwelling in vs.</p>
            <p>And yet more plainely doth <hi>Cyrillus</hi> open his owne meaning in the wordes that follow immediatly after the wordes that you cite. For he ſayth thus. <hi>Nec putet ex tarditate ment is ſuae Iudaeus, inaudita nobis excogitata eſſe myſteria: videbit enim ſi attentius quaerit, hoc ipſum a Moſis temporibus, per figuram ſemper factitatum fuiſſe.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9612:54"/> ſame thing hath bene done euer ſince the dayes of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For what was it that did delyuer their fathers from the wrath, when death did rage againſt the firſt borne of Egypt? Doe not all men knowe, that they being thorowly enſtructed of God, did eate the fleſhe of a Lambe, and did annoynt the two ſide poſtes and the vpper poſtes of their dores, with the bloud of the ſame, and that therfore death turned away from them. And a little after, he ſaith. <hi>Et cuinis carnibus at<expan>

            <p>I ſuppoſe that there is no man ſo mad, as to thinke, that theſe words of <hi>Cyrill</hi> ſhould be taken in ſuch ſort and meaning, as you take thoſe wordes that you cite. For then ſhoulde <hi>Cyrillus</hi> bée thought to aſcribe the deliuerance of the people from deſtruction, to the eating of the fleſhe of a Lambe, and the annoynting of the dore poſtes with the bloud thereof.

Shall we thinke therefore, that if the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our bodies and euerlaſting lyfe, be one of the effectes of the ſacrament of Chriſtes body and bloud: he muſt néedes vſe his abſolute power, in gyuing the reſurrection of body &amp; euerlaſting life, to as many as we wil hold from the receyuing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?</p>
            <p>It appéereth, that in <hi>Aunſtens</hi> time, ſuch as were of your minde, durſt not be ſo bolde,<note place="margin">The vſe in ſaint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens time.</note> as to preſume vpon the abſolute po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God in this point: and therefore they miniſtred the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtes body to the Infants ſo ſone as they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but we kéepe them from the receyuing of it, till they bée growne to diſcretion, and be ſufficiently inſtructed in Chriſt, and doe know how to examine themſelues before they come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lords table. And if they die in this meane while: ſhal we think that God muſt vſe his abſolute power in raiſing their bodies, &amp; giuing them euerlaſting lyfe? We might as well kéepe all our children from
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9612:56"/> baptiſme, and ſaye that God ſhall giue them the proper grace of baptiſme, by his abſolute power without the ſacrament. And ſo ſhould we be all one with the Anabaptiſtes.</p>

               </note> and therfore the obiection and the aunſwere that you make, can not be other then vayne.

            <p>And this frée gift was giuen to all the elect and choſen chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God: euen before the foundations of the world were layd.

               <hi>The greateſt argument that Ireneus could bring to proue the reſurrection of our fleſhe to lyfe eternall, was to alledge the cauſe of that reſurrection, which was the nouriſhing of our fleſhe with the lyuely fleſhe of Chriſt in the ſacrament, not to this temporall lyfe as other earthly meates doe, but to eternall lyfe, as onely Chriſtes fleſhe doth, and this cauſe was beleued and confeſſed of all men at that time, both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes and heretikes. In ſo much that theſe heretikes of our time, that denie this cauſe, that is to ſay, Chriſtes fleſhe to be really giuen in the ſacrament, and eaten of our fleſhe: doe giue occaſion, yea I am afrayde, doe giue more then oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,

            <p>This much hath <hi>Ignatius</hi> written in the place that you cite. And can any indifferent man gather of theſe words, that he ment here to teach, that our reſurrection is the effect of the ſacrament of Chriſts body and bloud? I thinke not. Yea I ſuppoſe,<note place="margin">Effectes doe ſpring out of efficient cauſes.</note> that none can gather that meaning of his wordes, but you, and ſuch as you are, whome affection hath blinded.

How
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9612:58"/> farre you and your ſort be from the harkening to Chriſt alone: may eaſily be ſéene of all that will conſider, the multitude of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that you haue brought into the Church of Chriſt, and doe eſtéeme them aboue the ordinaunce of God. Wherefore <hi>Ignatius</hi> might ſay vnto you, as he wryteth in the ſame Epiſtle. <hi>Similiter autem, &amp; omnis homo, quiſquis indicium a Deo accepit, punietur ſi im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritum paſtorem ſecutus fuerit, &amp; falſam opinionem vt veram exceperit.</hi> And in lyke maner euery man, that hath receyued at Gods hand habilitie to iudge: ſhall be puniſhed, if he ſhall follow an vnſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhepheard, and receyue a falſe opinion as true.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſée, that when <hi>Ignatius</hi> is well conſidered, he will be found none of thoſe auncient Authors, that doe commonlye teache this affect of the ſacrament of Chriſts body: but contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he will tell you that you ſhall be puniſhed, for that you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an vnſkilfull ſhepheard, and accept a falſe opinion as though the ſame were true. And euen in that place which you cite, hys wordes are flat againſt your doings, and therefore you diſſemble thoſe wordes, and begin with the next. He hath written thus <hi>Vnum panem frangentes, quod eſt. &amp;c.</hi> Breaking one loafe of bread, which is a medicine of immortalitie, and a preſeruatiue againſt death. Now tell me, how this breaking of one loafe of bread, doth or can agrée with your priuate Maſſe that you call the ſacrifice of the Church: and with your Popiſhe Eaſter houſell, when euery one hath a mock loafe by himſelf. <hi>Ignatius</hi> would haue the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians to breake (that is to be partakers of) one leafe of bread, and he ſayth that is a medicine of immortalitie, and a preſeruatiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt death.<note place="margin">Watſon was foule ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſene.</note> Why then.

They haue called this ſacrament, <hi>Symbola Reſurrectionis noſtrae.</hi> The pledges or cauſes of our reſurrection, ſay you.

Well I leaue this tranſlation of yours, to the iudgement of ſuch as be ſkilfull in the Gréeke and Latine tongues. But to our purpoſe. You ſhall neuer be able to proue that <hi>Symbolum</hi> ſignifieth a cauſe: but a pledge it may ſignifie. And what haue the fathers of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene counſell done for you then? Euen as much as <hi>Ignatius</hi> hath done before. I will not ſtick to graunt you both the ſayings to be true. The ſacrament of Chriſtes body and bloud,<note place="margin">Medicines be not the efficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of health.</note> is a medicine of immortalitie, a preſeruatiue againſt death, a purgation to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell euils, &amp; a pledge of our reſurrection. Are medicines, preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and purgations, the efficient cauſes of health? And how can this medicine, preſeruatiue and purgation, be the efficient cauſe of our reſurrection &amp; immortalitie? And is a pledge the efficient cauſe of the thing or déede that is promiſed when the pledge is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? For in that ſenſe is <hi>Symbolum</hi> taken here. And vnleſſe you can proue that theſe be efficient cauſes: you ſhal neuer prooue that our immortalitie and reſurrection be the effects thereof.</p>

            <p>Now let the indifferent reader iudge, how faithfully you haue vſed your ſelfe, in alledging the ſaying of this auncient Father. His grounde is, the wordes of Chriſt in the ſixt of Iohn. Where ſpeaking of the eating of his body he ſayth. It is the ſpirite that doth giue lyfe: the fleſhe profiteth nothing at all. The words that I haue ſpoken vnto you are ſpirite and lyfe. Which is (ſayth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi>) as much as if he ſhould ſay. My body, which is ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed and giuen for the world, ſhall be giuen to be foode, that it may ſpiritually be giuen to euery man, and that vnto eche man it may be made a defence and preſeruation to the reſurrection of eternall lyfe. And to make his meaning playne <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſayth: that Chriſt made mention of his aſcention into heauen, that he might draw his hearers, from the bodily vnderſtanding. And further he ſayth, that our ſauiour talking with the Samaritiſh woman: did draw hir from ſenſible things, affirming y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God is a ſpirit, that ſo ſhe might imagine no corporal thing to be in God, but al ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>I can not therefore but thinke, that ſuch as will ioyne with you in alledging this place to proue immortalitie and euerlaſting lyfe to be the effect of the ſacrament of Chriſtes body and bloud: are by obſtinate wylfulneſſe blinded, as you doe ſhewe your ſelfe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9612:59"/> to be. For it is as manifeſt as the cleare ſunne light: that his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was to diſproue the groſſe opinion of all ſuch as imagine,<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius.</note> that Chriſt ſhould giue his fleſhe to fill the bellies of men. And to teach, that ſuch as will benefite by eating of his body, muſt eate the ſame ſpiritually and not carnally.

For by this meanes, that is to ſaye, if theſe ſayings be true: neyther hath the Lorde redéemed vs with his bloud, neyther is the cup of thankeſgyuing, the communion of his bloud, nor the bread that we breake, the communion of his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:9612:60"/> bodye. For it is not bloud, except it come from the veynes and fleſhe and the other ſubſtaunce which is of mans nature. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſonne of God being borne in déede: hath with his owne bloud redéemed vs. Euen as his Apoſtle alſo ſayth: in whome we haue redemption, the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes through his bloud. And bicauſe we are members of him, and be nouriſhed by the creature. And he it is that giueth the creature vnto vs, cauſing his ſunne to ariſe, and rayning in ſuch ſort as it pleaſeth him, when he ſayde for a ſuretie, that the cup, which is a creature, is his body, whereby he doth giue encreaſe to our bodyes. When the mixed Cup therefore, and the bread that is made, doe receiue the ſonne of God: it is made the <hi>Euchariſte</hi> or thankeſgyuing of the bloud and body of Chriſt, whereof the ſubſtaunce of our fleſh is encreaſed and doth conſiſt. How doe they denie that fleſhe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receyue the gift of God, which is eternall lyfe, ſith the ſame is nouriſhed with the bloud and bodie of Chriſt, and is a member of him, as the Apoſtle ſaith in that Epiſtle which he wrot to the Epheſians. For we are members of his body, of his fleſhe and of his bones, not ſpeaking theſe wordes of any ſpirituall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible man (for a ſpirite hath neyther bones nor fleſhe) but of that diſpoſition of partes, that is in mans nature, which doth conſiſt of fleſhe, ſinewes and bones, which is nouriſhed by the cup that is his bloud, and encreaſed by the bread that is his body.</p>
            <p>Nowe let the Reader iudge, whether <hi>Ireneus</hi> may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanded to meane in this place, as you by cyting his wordes,<note place="margin">What maner men Ireneus had to doe with.</note> would haue him ſéeme to meane. Firſt, it is manifeſt by hys wordes, that he had to doe with ſuch men as did vtterly denie the reſurrection of our bodies. And he proueth that their aſſertion is verie veyne, ſith our bodies be nouriſhed in this lyfe, by the ſame creatures that our ſauiour Chriſt hath made the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of his body and bloud, which creatures we receyue at his hande, for he cauſeth the ſunne to ariſe and to warme the earth, and he it is that giueth raine to moyſten the earth, whereby the ſame bread and wine, that he hath aſſuredly ſayde is his body and bloud, doe grow out of the earth, wherby he doth giue our bodies encreaſe.</p>
            <p>And to what purpoſe ſhould he inſtitute the ſacrament of his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9612:61"/> body and bloud in thoſe creatures, if our nature, which he hath taken vpon him, and is nouriſhed by theſe creatures: ſhould not by him be made incorruptible and immortall? Howe can they therefore (ſayth <hi>Ireneus</hi>) denie that fleſhe is able to receyue the gift of God, which is eternall lyfe: ſith the ſame is nouriſhed with that creature that is the bloud and body of Chriſt, and is a member of him as the Apoſtle ſayth. &amp;c. Which wordes muſt be warily conſidered, leaſt we ſhould thinke that <hi>Ireneus</hi> doth deny, that the church of Chriſt is the ſpiritual or miſtical body of Chriſt, affirming that the ſame is his very naturall body, which he tooke of the ſubſtaunce of the Virgine Marie.<note place="margin">Wordes that muſt be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> But when theſe wordes be well weighed: it appéereth that <hi>Ireneus</hi> was earneſtly bent to diſproue not onely the opinion of ſuch as doe denie our reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but alſo their opinion that did affirme, that Chriſt tooke not mans nature vpon him, but had a fantaſticall body: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he applyed the wordes of Paule againſt that error, ſaying. <hi>Non de ſpirituali aliquo. &amp;c.</hi> He ſpake not thoſe wordes to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians, of any ſpirituall or inuiſible man, but of the diſpoſition of partes that is in man, which conſiſteth of fleſhe, ſinewes and bones. Vnderſtanding Saint Paules wordes in that meaning that the wordes of <hi>Laban</hi> muſt be vnderſtand, when he ſayde to <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

So <hi>Ireneus</hi> vnderſtandeth ſaint Paules wordes in that place, to ſignifie, that Chriſt and we, concerning his mans nature, be deſcended out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loynes of one man, that is the firſt man Adam. And ſo he concludeth, that for as much as our nature is nouriſhed and encreaſed by thoſe creatures bread and Wine, wherein Chriſt hath inſtituted the ſacrament of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud, and doth therefore call the ſame creatures, by the names of thoſe things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be ſacraments of: the ſame nature muſt néedes be made incorruptible and immortall through him that hath receyued it to himſelfe, and is himſelf incorruptible and immortall.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Watſon is to bolde with Ireneus.</note>Wherfore it ſéemeth to me (M. <hi>Watſon</hi>) that you are to bolde with <hi>Ireneus,</hi> when you affirme that his meaning is ſuch as we

For he ſayth that the bloud and body of Chriſt that he ſpeake of, is that whereby the ſubſtaunce of our fleſh is encreaſed &amp; doth continue. But you doe denie that. For you ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it nouriſheth not our fleſh as other earthly meates doe, to this temporal lyfe: but to eternall lyfe. I would gladly knowe therfore what <hi>Ireneus</hi> may meane by the encreaſing of the ſubſtaunce of our fleſhe by this foode.</p>
            <p>Well, this matter is playne ynough to as many as will ſée. And ſo it is, that neyther Catholikes, nor heretikes, did in the dayes of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> beléeue and confeſſe, that the ſacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt, is the cauſe of the vncorruption of our bodyes, and the eternall lyfe of the ſame. And that we which doe nowe denie our reſurrection and euerlaſting lyfe in an immortall ſtate, to be the effect of the ſacrament of Chriſts body and bloud: doe not giue thereby any iuſt occaſion, to be ſuſpected of the error of them that doe denie the reſurrection of our fleſhe. And for that you charge vs with beaſtlyneſſe of lyfe: for my part, I referre the iudgement to them that know vs both. Let other aunſwere for themſelues.</p>
            <p>Well. For further proufe of this effect, you could bring in many mo Authors, as the ſaying of <hi>Hilarius. &amp;c. Hilarius</hi> hath ſayde thus, ſay you. <hi>Haec vero vitae noſtrae cauſa eſt. &amp;c.</hi> This is the verie cauſe of our lyfe: that we haue Chriſt by his fleſh dwelling in our fleſhe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I muſt tell you that you ſhew your ſelfe to impudent in tranſlating the text that you cite out of <hi>Hilarius</hi> in this place.<note place="margin">Hilarius de Trinitate. li. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> Let the learned iudge whether <hi>Hilarius</hi> haue ſayde, this is the verie cauſe. &amp;c. And againe in the ende of the ſentence, dwelling in our fleſhe.

But this is a common thing with men of your ſort, not onely to alledge Patches out of the fathers, in ſuch
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9612:62"/> ſort that the true meaning cannot by the wordes that you cite be perceyued: but alſo, to make them ſéeme to ſerue your purpoſe, you will not ſtick to adde ſomewhat in the tranſlation that can not be founde in their wordes, as in this place it doth moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appéere.</p>

Truly this is the cauſe of our life: that we which be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or fleſhly, haue by the meanes of the fleſhe, Chriſt dwelling in vs: which ſhall liue through him, in ſuch ſort as he liueth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the father. If we therefore doe naturally liue through him, as touching the fleſh, that is, hauing obtayned the nature of hys fleſh: how ſhould it be, but that ſith he doth liue by the meanes of the father, he muſt néedes haue the father in himſelfe, naturally, as touching the ſpirite: And he doth lyue by the meanes of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeing that his natiuitie hath not giuen him a ſtraunge and contrarie nature, for as much as, that being that he hath, is of his father, and yet for all that, he is not by any vnlikelineſſe inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his nature, ſeparated from him; ſeing that through his natiuitie in the ſtrength of nature, he hath his father in himſelfe. We haue made mention of theſe things, bicauſe the Heretikes (which fayne that the vnitie betwéene the father and the ſonne, is onely the vnitie of will) haue vſed the example of our vnitie with God, as though, when we be by ſeruice onely and will of religion, knit vnto the ſonne, and by the ſonne to the father: there were no proprietie of naturall communion graunted vnto vs, by the ſacrament of his body and bloud: where as the myſterie of the true and naturall vnitie, is to be preached, both by the honor of the ſonne of God, which is giuen vnto vs, and alſo by the ſonne that is carnally abyding in vs, being bodily, and inſeparably ioyned togither in him.</p>
            <p>In the latter part of theſe words <hi>Hilarius</hi> doth playnely ſhew the cauſe that moued him to write after ſuch ſort as he doth in the former part of the ſame. The heretikes (ſayth he) which fayned that the vnitie betwixt the father and the ſonne, is onely the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of will. &amp;c. By this it is manifeſt, that his purpoſe was to proue: that the example whereby the heretikes would proue, that the vnitie that is betwixt Chriſt and his father, is but the vnity
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9612:63"/> of wyll: doth ſerue nothing for their purpoſe. For the vnitie that is betwixt Chriſt and vs, and through Chriſt betwéene God the father and vs: is not onely in wyll of religion and ſeruice, but naturall and true. And in Chriſt, we are bodily and inſeparably ioyned one to another, and doe altogither liue by the meanes of Chriſt, as Chriſt doth lyue by the meanes of his Father. And therfore he ſayth as you haue cited. <hi>Haec verò vitae noſtrae cauſa eſt. &amp;c.</hi> Verily, this is the cauſe of our lyfe. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nowe (M. <hi>Watſon</hi>) call to memorie, the admonition that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> gyueth in his Epiſtle, concerning the maners of ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that this author vſeth in his workes, and touching the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that he teacheth in this booke, wherout you alledge thoſe wordes that we haue nowe in hande: and then it ſhall appéere to you (I trowe) that you haue not vſed <hi>Hilarius</hi> well, in bearing men in hande, that he is one of them that teach our reſurrection and euerlaſting lyfe, to be the effect of the ſacrament of Chriſtes body and bloud. For if ſhall be playne that he meaneth to teache, that as Chriſt and his father be one in nature: ſo Chriſt and we that doe beléeue the promiſe that God hath made in him, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be by loue inſeparably ioyned one to another, and doe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oftentimes come togither, and be partakers of one loafe and one cup, whereby this perfite vnitie that we haue with God, and one with another, is playnely preached vnto vs, and euen oure verie ſenſes certefied, that we are by fayth inſeparably ioyned vnto Chriſt, as members to their head, and by loue one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as members of one body amongſt themſelues.

I dare therefore ſaye to ſuch as ſhall reade thys aunſwere, as ſaint Paule ſayth there, to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians. <hi>Vos ipſi iudicate quod dico.</hi> Be you your ſelues iudges of that which I ſpeake. Saint Paules purpoſe in that place, is to perſwade the Corinths: that they might in no caſe match chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten religion with Idole ſeruice. For a little after thoſe wordes that you cite, he ſayth. <hi>Nolo vos fieri ſocios Demoniorum. Non poteſtis Calicem Domini bibere, &amp; Calicem Demoniorum. Non poteſtis menſae Domini participes eſſe, &amp; menſae Demoniorum.</hi> I would not (ſayeth ſaint Paule) that you ſhould be made companions of Deuilles. You can not, or you may not drinke the Lordes cup, and the cup of the Deuils. You may not be partakers of the Lords table, and of the table of the Deuils.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:9612:66"/> and kéepe the religion of Chriſt pure and vnſpotted, with the mixture of any heatheniſh Gods ſeruice.

For ſo you doe expound the words that you cite out of Paule. <hi>Nonne communicatio. &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay (ſay you) doth it not ioyne and knit vs in the vnitie of one bodye in Chriſt? Sauing that I doe know it to be your common cuſtome, thus to handle both the ſcriptures, and the wrytings of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers: I would wonder that euer you could for ſhame make ſuch interpretation of theſe wordes. But nothing may be wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at, which cuſtome hath made common.</p>

Firſt I muſt note here, that you haue done, you wot not what. For you haue founde out for your maiſters of the newe learning, that which ſome of your fort haue ſayde, could not be founde in any part of the ſcripture: That is, that the ſacrament of Chriſts body, is called a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But let vs ſée what <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath ſayde. For it were not wiſedome to truſt you when you cite his ſentence without his wordes, as you doe here. His wordes therefore are theſe. <hi>Quare non dixit participatio? Quia amplius quiddam ſignificare voluit, &amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam inter haec conuenientiam oſtendere. Non enim participatione tantum &amp; acceptione: ſed vnitate communicamus. Quemadmodum enim corpus illud vnitum eſt Chriſto: ita nos per hunc panem vnione coniungimur.</hi> Why did he not call it a participation? Bicauſe he was wylling to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a greater matter, and to ſhew that there is great agréement betwéene theſe things. For we doe not communicate in taking and receyuing onely: but in vnitie alſo. For euen as that body is vnited vnto Chriſt: euen ſo are we by this bread, ioyned togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vnion.</p>
            <p>Now let the Reader compare theſe words of <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> with thoſe that you haue vſed in your Sermon, as though they were <hi>Chryſoſtomes:</hi> And ſo ſhall he be able to iudge how fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully you haue dealt therin. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayth that Paule doth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:9612:66"/> not call it a participation, but a communion, bicauſe he would by that worde ſignifie a greater matter, then he could by the other, and ſhewe that the things vſed in the communion, doe verie much agrée with thoſe that doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. As though he ſhould haue ſayde, it is a greater matter to communicate with Chriſt and chriſtians: then only to be partaker of thoſe creatures which be vſed in communicating. For ſuch as doe communicate with Chriſt and chriſtians, are become members of that body wherof Chriſt is the head, and doe receyue from Chriſt, ſpirituall lyfe, ſtrength, and comfort, as naturall partes of a naturall body, doe receyue naturall lyfe, ſtrength and comfort, from their naturall head. And ſuch as doe communicate with Chriſtians, are coupled togither in the felowſhip of members of one body, not onely with theſe chriſtians that are nowe lyuing: but with thoſe that haue bene before, and thoſe that ſhall be after alſo. And the creatures bread and wine doe ſerue verie well to ſignifie this communion both with Chriſt and chriſtians. And therefore Paule would vſe the worde Communion, rather then participation. And that this is <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> meaning in that place, is playne by the wordes that folow and I haue ſet downe in wryting. <hi>Non enim participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one. &amp;c.</hi> For we doe not communicate. &amp;c. Where, in the laſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence he ſayth. Euen as that body (meaning the Church that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth in vnitie) is vnited vnto Chriſt: ſo are we that be members of that body or Church, ioyned togither in vnion, by the vſe of this ſacramentall bread.</p>
            <p>And here is another thing that maketh verie well for your purpoſe (M. <hi>Watſon) Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayth. <hi>Per hunc Panem.</hi> By this bread. The matter or ſubſtaunce that he ſpeaketh of,<note place="margin">Chryſoſtome is no man for Watſon.</note> doth he call bread: but you and your ſort will none of that.

               </note>And yet once agayne <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> muſt helpe to expounde the wordes of Paule. His wordes be theſe (ſay you) <hi>Quid enim appello (inquit) communionem? &amp;c.</hi> What meaneth ſaint Paule. &amp;c. As for the fault that your printer hath made: I haue amended without any more to doe, as in many other places of your printed ſermons I haue done: but your owne ſubtile dealing in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, I may not paſſe ouer ſo. A man that had ment vprightly: would haue tranſlated the wordes of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> thus. What
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9612:67"/> doe I call communion, ſayth Paule? We all are one and the ſelfe ſame body. And what is the bread? The body of Chriſt. And what are they made that doe receyue the body of Chriſt? Not many, but one body. Nowe, what helpeth this to prooue your purpoſe? That is, that our knitting togither into one body, is the effect of the ſacrament. The Communion, that is to ſay, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inſtitution of Chriſt, in breaking of ſacramentall bread: doth teach that we which be partakers thereof, be all one and the ſelfe ſame body, and bicauſe we be ſo, therefore we doe frequent and vſe that action. We are not therefore made one body by this doing, but being ſo before, by fayth that worketh by loue: we doe by frequenting that myſterie, ſhewe our ſelues ſo to be. And the bread is the body of Chriſt. Not as you would haue vs beléeue that it is: but ſacramentally.<note place="margin">The effect of ſacraments.</note> And by the common rule of ſacraments, it hath the name of that thing whereof it is a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is called the body of Chriſt, &amp; ſuch as doe receyue this body of Chriſt, are made one body and not many. Not bicauſe they were not one body before they did receyue that ſacrament: but bicauſe they be thereby made knowne to be one body. For if the receyuing of the ſacrament ſhould make them ſuch: then ſhould it folow, that as often as they receiue that ſacrament: they ſhould afreſhe be made one body, which can be done but once. And that is, when (being elected in Chriſt from the beginning) they be in time moued by Gods holy ſpirite, to beléeue in hart and confeſſe with mouth, that Ieſus Chriſt, the ſonne of God, hath dyed for our ſinnes, and is riſen agayne for our righteouſneſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, or doe conſent to receyue, or be méete to receyue the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Initiation y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God hath appointed, which was in the time of Moſes law circumciſion, and is now baptiſme in water. Thus are we firſt made and ſhewed to be members all of one body: and by the vſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſacrament, oftentimes ſhewed to be the ſame.</p>
            <p>The buſineſſe that you make about the other wordes of ſaint Paule, that is to ſay. <hi>Vnus panis, vnum corpus. &amp;c.</hi> One bread, one body. &amp;c. might verie well haue bene ſpared. For when Saint Paule ſayth, <hi>Omnes enim de vno pane participamus:</hi> We doe all take parte of one loafe of bread: he meaneth not to ſtreatch the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall

And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> this is his meaning may well appéere, by that he ſaith thus to the Corinthians. <hi>Videte Iſrael ſecundum carnem. &amp;c.</hi> Conſider Iſraell after the fleſhe. Are not all they partakers of the aultar: that doe eate of the ſacrifices? Paules purpoſe in theſe wordes: is to open his meaning in the other. It muſt néedes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low therefore, that he meaneth of particuler congregations, and not of the vniuerſall Church: as you would fayne haue him to meane: you haue therefore made more a doe then néeded.</p>
            <p>Let vs nowe ſée, what helpe you finde at the hande of ſaint <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cyprian De Caena Domi.</note> He ſayth. <hi>Aequa omnibus portio datur. &amp;c.</hi> Equall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is giuen to al. &amp;c.

Nowe (ſayth <hi>Cyprian</hi>) there is no chaunging of the bread, there is one loafe of bread, which hath in it a continuall heate, and is of ſound ſtate, which being once offered to God, doth ſtill remayne in moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt or ſwéete taſte and pure whyteneſſe. Neyther doth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of this leuiticall dignitie, admit prieſtes onely to eate of the loaues: the vniuerſall Church is inuited or bidden to this feaſt. Equall or like portion is giuen to euery one. It is delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red whole, and being diſtributed, it is not torne in péeces. It is incorporated and not iniuried. It is receyued and not included. Dwelling among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weake, it is not made weake, neyther doth it diſdaine the miniſterie of the poore. A pure fayth, a ſincere minde, doe delight this tenaunt.

            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:9612:68"/>
            <p>If you had cyted all theſe words: <hi>Cyprians</hi> meaning would haue bene ſomewhat more playne, to ſuch hearers as had not bene altogither blinded with affection to that doctrine that you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to maintayne. It is manifeſt that <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth here ſpeake of Chriſt, which is that bread which came from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and was figured by the <hi>Manna</hi> that fell from heauen in the wylderneſſe, and by the ſhewe breads, that were by the law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be ſet before the Arcke in the Tabernacle, and to bée chaunged euery day: whereof none might eate, but onely thoſe Prieſtes that were of the leuiticall lyne. But this bread Ieſus Chriſt being once offered, remayneth for euer. And all the whole Church of Chriſt, is called to come &amp; féede vpon this bread. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man that wyth pure fayth and ſincere minde, commeth to féede vpon him: ſhall receyue him whole. And though he be by fayth eaten of all: yet is he not, neyther can he be conſumed, nor torne in péeces. Yea, a little before thoſe wordes that I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth. <hi>Vna eſt domus Eccleſiae, in qua Agnus editur, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus ei communicat, quem Iſraelitici nominis generoſitas non commendat.</hi> It is the onely houſe of the Church, wherein the Lambe is eaten: none is made partaker thereof, whome the nobilitie of the name of Iſraell doth not commend. By theſe wordes it is moſt euident that <hi>Cyprian</hi> ment to teache, that ſuch as ſhall be partakers of Chriſt, muſt by election in Chriſt, be made méete thervnto, being commended by the nobilitie of the name of ſpirituall Iſraell, whereof the carnall Iſraell was a figure. And their Lambe, <hi>Manna,</hi> and ſhew bread:<note place="margin">Cyprians meaning was farre other then was Watſons.</note> a figure of that euerlaſting bread which he ſpeaketh of here. So farre of is he from confirming of that which you would prooue, that is, that our knitting togither in Chriſt, is the effect of the ſacrament of the aultar, as you call it.</p>
            <p>Yet one thing more I muſt néedes note in the words of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</hi> He ſayth that all the whole Church is called to this banc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and that equall portion is giuen to euery one. How agréeth this with your priuate Maſſes, and your withholding of the one halfe of the ſacrament from the laye ſort.</p>

We men, being all diuers in our owne proper ſubſtaunce. &amp;c. Well, though the Latine were longer then it is; yet would I be bolde to trouble the reader with it: bicauſe it ſhall make manifeſt to all men that will read it, that it was not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to auoyde tediouſneſſe, that moued you to leaue out the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, but a purpoſe to blinde the ſimple hearer or reader of your ſubtile Sermon. The words of <hi>Cyrill</hi> in Latine are thus. <hi>Diſsecti enim quodammodo in ſubſiſtentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propriam, hoc eſt ſingularem, iuxta quam hic quidem eſt Petrus, ille Thomas vel Matheus: eiuſdem corporis facti ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in Chriſto, vna carne paſti, &amp; vno ſpiritu ſancto, ad vnitatem obſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.

And bicauſe Chriſt can not be deuided (for he is by no meanes deuided) we are all one thing in him.</p>
            <p>Nowe let the indifferent reader iudge, howe faythfully you haue handled this place of <hi>Cyrill.</hi> And as he ſhall finde you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful herein: ſo let him giue credit to the reſt of your doings. <hi>Cyrill</hi> hath ſayde that we be all one thing in Chriſt, bicauſe Chriſt can not be deuided: &amp; you ſay, that we be made all one body in Chriſt, bicauſe we bée fed with one fleſhe. &amp;c. And bicauſe Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not able to be deuided.

No maruell though you would not cite the Latine: ſeing you were minded to ſwarue ſo farre from it in your Engliſhe. But <hi>vna carne paſti:</hi> Being fed with one fleſhe, is the grounde that you builde vpon.

            <p>Yet once more muſt <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> helpe to proue this effect. You ſay that he doth expreſſe this vnitie by a ſimilitude of Dough or Leuen. &amp;c. His words be theſe (you ſay) <hi>veniat tibi in mentem. &amp;c.</hi>

And this is alſo to be noted. That when you are come to, <hi>Chriſti corpus vnum &amp; vnae caro,</hi> one bodye of Chriſt and one fleſhe: you paſſe ouer twice ſo much matter as you haue cited, and then in Engliſhe you go on with theſe wordes.

            <p>But nowe that your ſtore is well ſpent: you vſe your figure of Rhetoricke to blere the readers eye withall.

            <p>Wherefore, ſeing you haue not as yet proued, neyther ſhall hereafter be able to proue, eyther by the wordes of the ſcripture, or of the auncient fathers, that our knitting togither into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Chriſt, is the effect of your ſacrament of the aultar: it is no wickedneſſe nor blaſphemie at all, to aſcribe that effect to the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe thereof, which is God the father, through his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and the holy ghoſt.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:9612:73"/> agnoſcitur altaris Domini conſecratio.</hi> Thou haſt made ready a table. &amp;c.

               </hi> And where he ſayth <hi>Domini,</hi> of the Lord: you would haue men thinke, that he ſayth <hi>Domini noſtri:</hi> of our Lorde. And this is the common maner of al your ſort in theſe dayes (I meane Engliſhe Papiſtes) you can not abide that conſecration, ſhould be vnderſtanded of any other thing, then that magicall maner of breathing out wordes vpon creatures. Nor that he which hath made all things, and therefore is Lorde of all: ſhould be called the Lord, which doth ſignifie that he is not onely Lorde of one ſort of people: but of all nations alſo, and of all creatures.</p>
            <p>But what help may you haue by the words of <hi>Chryſoſtome?</hi> doth he not within a fewe lynes after, write thus? <hi>Et quia iſtam menſam praeparauit ſeruis &amp; ancillis in conſpectu eorum, vt quotidiè in ſimilitudinem corporis &amp; ſanguinis Chriſti, panem &amp; vinum ſecundum ordinem Melchiſedech, nobis oſtenderet in ſacramento: ideo dicit: Parasti in conſpectu meo menſam, aduerſus eos qui tribulant me.</hi> And bicauſe he hath made readie for his men ſeruants and women ſeruants, this table in their preſence, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he might daily ſhew vnto vs bread and wine, to be a ſimilitude or lykeneſſe of the body and bloud of Chriſt after the order of <hi>Melcheſedech:</hi> he doth ſay, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt prepared a table in my ſight, againſt them that trouble me.</p>
            <p>Nowe, if you will néedes vrge the wordes that you cite for your purpoſe (which notwithſtanding, make nothing for you) I pray you be not diſpleaſed, if I vrge theſe wordes, which are very playne to proue, that in the ſacrament are both bread and wine,<note place="margin">Watſons ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt himſelfe.</note> and that the ſame is appointed to be a ſimilitude of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Chriſt.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:9612:74"/> playne blaſphemie to aſcribe this glorious effect to the néedie ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this worlde, as to bread and wine.</p>
            <p>But nowe, I trowe you haue founde a wytneſſe, that will not be ſo ſone diſproued. <hi>Euthymius,</hi> a Gréeke Author ſayth ſo alſo. A man might aſke you, why <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> might not haue bene called a Gréeke author, as well as <hi>Euthymius.</hi> But your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was (as I ſuppoſe) to make the worlde beléeue that <hi>Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi> is as auncient as <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> And therefore you cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple them togither, preſuppoſing that all the learned doe knowe, that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> wrote in Gréeke. But when the antiquitie of <hi>Euthymius</hi> ſhall be ſearched: he ſhall be founde yonger then <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> by eyght hundred yeares.

            <p>But what hath he ſayde? He ſayth (ſaye you) <hi>Per hanc men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam intelligit. &amp;c.</hi> He vnderſtandeth. &amp;c. As though the Prophet Dauid had vnderſtanded nothing elſe by this worde table: but the table of the aultar, wherevpon the myſticall ſupper doth lye. But ſurely (M. <hi>Watſon</hi>) I can not wonder ynough at your ſawcie malapartneſſe,<note place="margin">Watſon is ſawcie and malapart.</note> which hath moued you to make your wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being a Gréeke, to ſpeake that by your mouth and Pen in Engliſhe: which he himſelfe would neuer write in Gréeke.

And thys table (ſayth he) haſt thou prepared, in the preſence of mine enimies, that when they ſée it, they may be ſorrowfull, and euen waſte away with ſorrowe. Or elſe agaynſt them: that is contrarie to that which they doe deſire or would wiſhe: For they doe alwayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour, rather to make me ſorrowfull and heauie: Or elſe he doth vnderſtand by the table, the fruition of thoſe good things to come, which God hath prepared for them that loue him: or the table of the aultar, whereon that myſticall ſupper doth lye, or elſe he doth vnderſtande by it morall vertue.</p>
            <p>If it had pleaſed you to haue cyted all theſe wordes: your witneſſe ſhould haue appéered a farre more honeſt man then you. And ſome of your faithfull hearers (whoſe credite you would not by your curioſitie ſéeme to miſtruſt) would ſurely haue ſayde that you had produced a wytneſſe againſt your ſelfe.<note place="margin">Watſon hath produced a wytneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> For what one worde is there in all this (beſide that little péece that you haue picked out) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can be wreſted to haue any ſhewe to ſerue your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:9612:75"/> you haue diſordred, with the reſt that you leaue out, as not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayning to your purpoſe. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath ſayde thus: <hi>Merito enim trahebatur dolentium paenitentia tempore longiore, vt infirmis, ſi qui eſſent, in exitu ſubueniretur. &amp;c.</hi> The repentaunce of ſuch as ſorowed for their fall, was for good cauſe continued for longer time, that if any of them ſhould fall ſicke, we might ſuccour them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of this lyfe: ſo long as we had tranquilitie and quiet, which would ſuffer vs to deferre the teares of the ſorrowful long time, and at the laſt ſuccour them in their infirmitie, when they ſhould lye in dying. But nowe, peace is néedefull, not for them that be ſick, but for ſuch as be ſtrong. And we muſt giue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, not to them that be at the point of death, but to them that lyue: that we doe not leaue thoſe vnarmed and naked, whom we ſturre vp &amp; exhort to battle, but that we arme them with the protection of the bloud &amp; body of Chriſt. And ſeing the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> or thankeſgyuing, is made for this purpoſe, that it may be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to ſuch as receyue it, let vs arme with the defence of the Lords full féeding, ſuch as we would wiſh ſhould be ſafe againſt the enimie. For how doe we teach and prouoke them to ſhed their owne bloud in the confeſſion of the name of Chriſt: if we doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to giue his bloud in them that muſt fight? Or howe doe we make them méete for the cup of martyrdome: if we doe not firſt admit them, in the Church to drinke the cup of the Lorde in the right of communion.</p>
            <p>Here are <hi>Cyprians</hi> wordes, in ſuch ſort as he wrote them. And the occaſion that he had to write thus: was the euill opinion, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> then Biſhop of Rome, had conceyued of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and other Biſhops, for that they had receyued to communion, ſuch as had before fallen, in yéelding to the perſecutours, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the crueltie of torments vſed vpon them.</p>
            <p>To this doth <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the other Byſhops to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>.39.</hi> anſwere in this Epiſtle. Shewing (as is afore written) that it were not méete, that ſuch as through frailtie haue fallen, and doe with bitter teares lament their fall: ſhould when perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is threatned and lyke to come, be driuen from the Lordes table, and not ſuffred to be partakers of that ſacrament, that our
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9612:75"/> Lorde Ieſus hath inſtituted to be an outwarde aſſuraunce of that which he hath promiſed in his worde. For what reaſon were it, to perſwade men to ſtande manfully to the profeſſion of Chriſt, and warant them euerlaſting lyfe, if they ſuffer loſſe of this lyfe for his ſake: and yet denie to giue them the holye communion, which Chriſt hath inſtituted to be a ſeale of that promiſe?<note place="margin">The beſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for Chriſtians.</note> No armour can be ſo ſure, and make a man ſo bolde and couragious againſt his enimie: as to be aſſured, that his quarell is ſuch, that if he die therein, he ſhall not fayle to lyue and raigne in glorious tryumph for euer. <hi>Cyprian</hi> therefore, doth verie well in vſing theſe <hi>Metaphers:</hi> calling that ſacrament that was ordeyned to be an aſſuraunce of this euerlaſting triumph, by the names of protection, defence, and ſaufegarde.</p>

            <p>Well, you haue yet one other place of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but you ſpare the Latine, thinking it ſufficient, to tell your hearers and readers, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth ſo.

            <p>A man would thinke that a Doctour of Diuinitie (that had read this homilie,<note place="margin">The title of Doctor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth many.</note> &amp; were acquainted with ſuch figures as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> doth commonly vſe, when he taketh in hande to ſet forth

            <p>The excéeding great vertue, that this bloud that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaketh of, hath: is ſuch, that no man can be able, eyther with tongue or pen to declare it at the full.

And ſo many as be ſprinckled with this bloud (that is, as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected in Chriſt, be called by the preaching of the Goſpell, and doe obey the caller) may, when they fall into temptation, aſſure themſelues, that the tempter will when he ſéeth them be ſprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and waſhed with this bloud: flie from them, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayth here.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:9612:77"/> thinke, that you meane well and truely. But let vs ſée what may be ſayde to theſe wordes of <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> Firſt I muſt let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſée, a fewe wordes that go before thoſe that you cite, ſo ſhall he be the better able to iudge whether you haue dealt vprightly in alledging them for your purpoſe, or no. He writeth thus. <hi>Suſcipe ante Dominum Ieſum tuae mentis hoſpitio. Vbi Corpus eius, ibi Chriſtus: eſt. Cum hoſpitium tuum aduerſarius viderat occupatum caeleſtis fulgore praeſentiae, intelligens locum tentamentis ſuis intercluſum eſſe per Chriſtum fugiet ac recedet.</hi> Receyue before hande, the Lorde Ieſus into the harbour of thy minde. Chriſt is there, where his body is. When the enimie ſhall perceyue that the brightneſſe of the heauenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, doth poſſeſſe thy lodging, and vnderſtand that Chriſt hath encloſed the place from his temptations, he wyll flye and depart awaye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth here teach vs to receyue Chriſt. Firſt, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally into our mindes by faith: and then ſacramentally in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. The ſcripture that gaue him occaſion to wryte thus, is the ſixt verſe of the eyght part of the <hi>.118.</hi> Pſalme, after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the <hi>.70.</hi> The wordes of the verſe are theſe. At midnight did I ariſe to prayſe thée. &amp;c. By occaſion of theſe wordes <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> doth earneſtly exhort all Chriſtians to giue themſelues to meditation both night and daye: but ſpecially at ſuche time as publike faſting ſhould be appointed. The dayes were then trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and chriſtians were well moſt continually perſecuted. Wherefore, they did often at the appointment of their Paſtours,<note place="margin">The right vſe of faſting.</note> abſtayne from all maner of bodily ſuſtenaunce, and from ſléepe, and gaue themſelues to prayer in the congregation, and did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. So aſſuring, euen their ſenſes, that though they ſhould fall into the perſecutors handes: yet ſhould there no harme hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto them. For they were ſurely cowpled vnto Chriſt, and one to another. So that though they ſhould ſéeme to the worlde to periſhe: yet they were in déede, deliuered from miſerie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued into endleſſe felicitie. And for this cauſe doth <hi>Ambroſe</hi> call this ſacrament <hi>Munimentum.</hi> A defence. For by it, we be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly certified of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and that we are reconciled and receyued into fauour with God againe.</p>
            <pb n="138" facs="tcp:9612:78"/>
            <p>This is not to teach, that after the receyuing of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the aultar (as you terme it) the Deuill can finde no way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the receiuer: but that when we haue receyued Chriſt by faith, and doe declare the ſame by communicating with the reſt of Chriſtes members: then may we aſſure our ſelues, that there is no way for the enimie to enter. And therefore, he will flie away, and as ſaint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, depart from vs. For Chriſt is in poſſeſſion, and none is able to remoue him.</p>
            <p>But I muſt ſtill maruayle that you ſée not, that all theſe whome ye alledge: doe fight againſt you for your priuate Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. And that this <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth giue you warning, that if you will be defended againſt the Deuill, and haue him ſhut out: you muſt firſt receiue Chriſt into the harbour of your minde,<note place="margin">Chriſt muſt be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde before the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament come in the mouth.</note> which is by faith. For <hi>Ambroſe</hi> knewe, that if Chriſt were not in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the minde, before the ſacrament came into the mouth: the receyuing ſhould be to condempnation. And then it doth not ſhut out the Deuill: but make an open way for him to enter.</p>
            <p>But nowe let vs ſée what <hi>Nazianzen</hi> hath ſaide. You ſay, that his words be thus. <hi>Menſa haec. &amp;c.</hi> This table, and ſo forth, as is afore.

And if any ſhall doubt of my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing therein: let the ſame ſearch the place and be ſatiſfied.

Would God it might be my lot to poure out vnto God, a ſwéete ſauour of this oyntment. I

            <p>Nowe let the learned reader iudge, how well you deſerue to be credited another time when you cite any thing out of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers. <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath ſayde. Or in which I doe reſt and delight my ſelfe, and doe nothing offend, by reaſon of ſacietie or fulneſſe. But you thought good, not to trouble your hearers with any of thoſe wordes: leaſt they ſhould ſée that <hi>Gregorie</hi> and you be of two mindes. You make your tale ſmooth and whole, as though you had not lept ouer any of <hi>Gregories</hi> words. For thus you ſay. This table is prepared of God, againſt them that vexe and trouble me,<note place="margin">Crafty hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the fathers ſayings.</note> by which I quench and pacifie al rebellion of my naughtie affections. Who would thinke that there were any worde left out? So craftily can you handle the wordes of aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers, to make them ſéeme to ſerue your purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But when the wordes of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> are conſidered wholy togither, and conferred with that which goeth before and folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after: it ſhall appéete that <hi>Gregories</hi> meaning was to declare in what pointes, the acceptable exerciſe of Chriſtian religion doth conſiſt and ſtande. In pureneſſe of ſoule, and chéerefulneſſe of minde: not in bodily mirth, gorgious apparell, eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wantonneſſe. Not in furniſhing of houſes and dores, with flowers, nor burning of lights, nor playing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Inſtruments. &amp;c. For ſuch was the order of the heatheniſh ſolemnitie. He would haue ſuch Lamps as might light the whole bodye of Chriſtes Church, and the whole worlde. And he ſayth, that he meaneth the holy word of God therby. In compariſon of this light, ſaith he: I eſtéeme not much of all thoſe lightes that men vſe in the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of their feaſtes. And then folow thoſe words that I haue before written. And immediatly after thoſe wordes, he ſayth. I haue alſo a fielde (which the Lorde hath bleſſed) full of flowers, more flouriſhing and more durable, then any flowers that growe in the ſpring time. I meane (ſayth he) the Prieſts, and ſwéete ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoring

            <p>Now (M. <hi>Watſon</hi>) how ſay you by your <hi>Nazianzen?</hi> will you haue him to allowe your priuate Maſſes with their effectes? your Tapers and Torchlight, your ringing &amp; ſinging with blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Organs?

No, no, all wiſe men may ſée, that he is of a farre other minde.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs ſée what <hi>Cyrillus</hi> will ſaye to this matter. He ſayth (ſay you) <hi>Non mortem ſolum. &amp;c.</hi> Not onely death. &amp;c. If I did not know your olde maner in falſifiyng the ſayings of aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers: I could neuer maruayle ynough at your beaſtly blindneſſe, in cyting this place for your purpoſe. You would haue <hi>Cyrill</hi> to beare you recorde, that the ſacrament of the aultar, is an armour and defence, againſt the temptations of our ghoſtly enimie. &amp;c. To make his words more plaine to the reader: I will let him ſée in wryting a fewe of thoſe wordes that go before, that which you cite. Firſt, he ſpeaketh in the perſon of him that doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of hauing any commoditie, by the receyuing of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtes body and bloud: bicauſe ſaint Paule hath ſayde, that whoſoeuer ſhall eate the bread, and drinke the cup vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, ſhall eate and drinke his owne condemnation. And I (ſaith ſuch one) doe examine my ſelfe, and finde my ſelfe vnworthye. When therefore (ſayth <hi>Cyrill</hi>) wilt thou (whoſoeuer thou art that ſpeakeſt theſe wordes) be worthy? When wilt thou offer thy ſelfe to Chriſt? For if thou be vnworthy bicauſe thou doeſt ſinne, and thou leaueſt not of ſinning (for who doth vnderſtande his owne ſinne, as ſayth the Pſalmiſt) then ſhalt thou be vtterly without any part of this ſanctification. To this he aunſwereth thus. <hi>Quare pias quaeſo cogitationes ſuſcipias, ſtudioſe ſancte<expan>

Sedat enim cum in nobis maneat Chriſtus: ſeuien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem membrorum noſtrorum legem, pietatem corroborat, perturbationes ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi extinguit, nec in quibus ſumus peccatis conſyderat: ſed aegrotos curat, colliſos redintegrat, &amp; ſicut paſtor bonus, qui animam ſuam pro omnibus
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:9612:79"/> poſuit, ab omni nos erigit caſu.</hi> I pray thée therefore take in hande godly cogitations. Sée that thou doe lyue ſtudiouſly and holyly, and thou mayſt be partaker of the benediction. Which (beleue me) doth not onely driue away death, but all ſickneſſes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes alſo. For when Chriſt dwelleth in vs he doth ſtill the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging law of our members, he doth confirme and ſtrenthen godly deuotion, he quencheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parturbations of the mind. Neither doth he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the ſinnes wherin we are: but he maketh whole ſuch as be ſicke, &amp; them ſound that be broken. And as a good ſhepherd that hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his life for his ſhéepe: he doth lift vs vp, as oft as we fal.</p>
            <p>If a man ſhould aſke <hi>Cyrill,</hi> what it is that driueth awaye death and diſeaſes, he would ſay, the benediction or ſanctification, that is Chriſt. For (as ſaint Paule ſayth) he is our ſanctification.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> And that ſinner that foloweth <hi>Cyrilles</hi> counſell, néedeth not to doubt of ſanctification by Chriſt, and conſequently, he néedeth not to feare to be partaker of that ſacrament that was inſtituted to confirme and ſtrengthen vs in the beliefe of our ſanctification in him. And if a man ſhould aſke him, who it is that ſtylleth the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging law of our members. &amp;c. He would aunſwere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But if a man ſhould bid you make your reaſon perfite, by putting to ſo many Verbes one Nominatiue caſe, at the leaſt (for it is a verie vnperfite oration wherein there is no Nominatiue caſe, as Grammarians ſay) it is to be thought that you muſt ſay,<note place="margin">An oration without a Nameyng caſe.</note> that <hi>Sacramentum altaris,</hi> the ſacrament of the aultar is the Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue caſe to al thoſe verbes. And then ſhal it appéere how <hi>Cyrill</hi> and you doe agrée, &amp; how cleanly you haue conueyed your matter.</p>
            <p>But nowe you conclude your treatiſe vpon this effect, with a maruellous exclamation: wondering firſt at the ſtraunge ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes that this ſacrament hath brought forth, &amp; then at the lardge conſcience of your late teachers (deſtroyers of Chriſtes flock, you ſay) which take away this armour, which was none other thing but to leaue you naked and vnarmed againſt the Deuill, that he might preuayle. &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9612:80"/> they neyther teach that theſe effectes doe ſpring out of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the aultar: nor that your late teachers haue robbed you of any treaſure. For they did but take from you ſuch toyes as your father the Pope had deuiſed for you. Neyther did thoſe teachers plant among you a bare Ceremonie: for they reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red agayne the Sacrament of the bodye and bloud of Chriſt, which you and your ſort, had ſo diſguiſed with your ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that it could not be knowne for any ſacrament of Chriſt. They taught not, that it is nothing elſe but bread and wine: but they taught, and we doe teach, that it is ſacramentall bread and wine, and that being receyued by the member of Chriſt, it is the miſticall body of Chriſt, and worketh in him as much as our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt did ordeyne it to worke: That is, the certifying of his weake nature: that euerlaſting life is purchaſed for him, by the death and bloud ſhedding of Chriſt: And that he is vnſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly knit vnto Chriſt his head, and vnto the reſt of Gods choſen children. And this is not the effect of bread and wine: But of him that worketh by his ſacraments as by inſtruments. But nowe you haue one effect more, and ſo an ende of this matter.</p>

            </p>
            <p>According to your cuſtome, you leaue out thoſe wordes that might make the writers meaning playne. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that for as much as neyther the Apoſtle Paule, nor an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell from heauen, might declare or teache any otherwiſe, then Chriſt himſelfe had once taught, and his Apoſtles had declared: he maruelled, that contrarie to the Euangelicall, and Apoſtolicall doctrine, there was in ſome places water offered in the Lordes cup, which coulde not of it ſelfe alone, expreſſe the bloud of the Lorde. The ſacrament wherof the holy ghoſt doth not paſſe ouer in the Pſalmes, making mention of the Lordes cup and ſaying: Thy cup, which doth make dronke, is excéeding good. And the cup that maketh men dronke, is ſurely mixed with wine: for water can not make any man dronken. And the Lordes cup doth make a man dronke, euen as <hi>Noe</hi> was made droken when he dranke wine, as it is written in <hi>Geneſis.</hi> And then doe thoſe wordes that you haue cyted, ſolow.</p>
            <p>All indifferent readers maye perceyue by theſe wordes of <hi>Cyprian</hi> what his meaning was. Not to teach, that the ſpiritual dronkenneſſe, is the effect of the ſacrament: but that the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might not be miniſtred with water alone without wine. For vnleſſe it haue in it, a naturall ſtrength to make the drinkers dronken: it can not expreſſe, that is to ſay, it can not lyuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9612:81"/> the bloud of Chriſt, which being dronken of ſuch as bée members of his body, in ſpirite by fayth, and ſacramentally in the ſacrament, according to his inſtitution: doth make them dronken with that dronkenneſſe that ſaint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaketh of here. And to make his meaning more playne, he addeth to the ende of thoſe words that you haue cyted, theſe playne and manifeſt wordes. <hi>Et quemadmodum vino iſto communi, mens ſoluitur, &amp; anima relaxatur, &amp; triſtitia omnis exponitur: ita &amp; potato ſanguine Domini, &amp; poculo ſalutari, exponatur memoria veteris hominis, &amp; fiat obliuio conuerſationis priſtinae ſecularis: &amp; moeſtum pectus &amp; triſte, quod prius peccatis angentibus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mebatur, diuinae indulgentiae laetitia reſoluatur.

Which cup may chéere him that drinketh it in the Church of the Lord, when the thing that is dronken, doth hold the truth of the Lorde.</p>
            <p>By theſe wordes of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> it is manifeſt that he meaneth of ſuch a dronkenneſſe as ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> doth,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſalm. <hi>22.</hi>

            <p>In the beginning of the matter that ſaint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth handle in the place that you cite:<note place="margin">Ambroſ. in Pſal. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> he ſayth thus. <hi>Hoc primum bibe.</hi> Drinke this cup firſt. And ſhortly after he ſayth thus. <hi>Prodeſt tibi cor habere contritum.

It ſignifieth the cup of tribulation. And after a fewe wordes he ſayth. <hi>Bibe primum, vt ſitim mitiges: Bibe ſecundùm, vt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitatem haureas. In veteri testamento compunctio, in nouo laeticia eſt.</hi> Drinke the firſt Teſtament, that thou mayſt mitigate thy thirſt: drinke the ſecond, that thou mayſt drinke to the full. In the olde Teſtament there is hartie ſorowe for ſinne, in the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ioy and gladneſſe. And to auoyde tediouſneſſe, let me faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rehearſe in Engliſhe, the wordes that go immediatly before thoſe wordes that you cite. Sée (ſayth ſaint <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) howe the Lorde hath on the hehalfe of his ſeruants: matched the diſceites of the Deuill. He did with one morſell of meat diſceyue one man: that he might in one, circumuent all. But Ieſus hath redéemed all, with the meate of ſaluation: that in all, he might reforme him that had bene diſceyued. The Deuill did inuent the golden Cup of Babilon, that ſuch as ſhould drinke thereof, might be more thirſtie: and that bicauſe the drinke coulde not be pleaſaunt, he might allure them with the price of the Golde. He began vnto them of his owne wine, wherevnto he ſought to haue the helpe of the metall. But the Lorde Ieſus did poure water out of the rock, and ſo forth, as you haue cited. And to the ende of thoſe wordes that you cite: he addeth theſe. Neyther let it moue thée, that the Babilonion Cup is of Golde: for thou doeſt drinke the Cup of wiſedome, which is more precious then is Gold or Siluer. Drink both the Cups therefore, both the olde and the new Teaſtament. For in eche of them thou doeſt drinke Chriſt. Drinke Chriſt: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the wine. Drinke Chriſt: bicauſe he is the rock, that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metted out the water. Drinke Chriſt: bicauſe he is the Fountaine of lyfe. Drinke Chriſt: bicauſe he is the riuer, the ruſhing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Drinke Chriſt: that thou mayſt drinke the bloud wherewith thou waſt redéemed. Drinke Chriſt, that thou mayſt drinke his worde. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nowe (M. <hi>Watſon</hi>) if you haue not dronke ſo déepe of the <hi>Babilonicall</hi> cup, that you be thereby fallen into the deadly ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Romiſhe obſtinacie: you muſt néedes ſée that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth not in this place meane to maintaine your aſſertion: That is, that the ſpirituall dronkenneſſe, is the effect of the ſacrament of the aultar.

                  </expan> in finem: quoniam finem bonum habuit eorum conuerſatio. &amp;c.</hi> In this place (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) I ſuppoſe that he ſpeaketh of the helpe that the brethren ſhould haue at their handes. This is it that he meaneth when he ſayth, which haue ſpoken the worde of God to you, the ende of whoſe conuerſation when ye doe behold, you follow their fayth. What meaneth he when he ſayth, when you doe beholde? He ſayth as much as if he had ſayde. When you doe toſſe it and tumble it in your mindes, and doe examine it with your ſelues, conſidering and diſcuſſing it thorowly. The ende of their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that is, their perſeueraunce to the ende: bicauſe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation had a good ende. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt, that <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> doth vnderſtande ſaint Paules purpoſe in this place to be, chiefely to put the Hebrues in remembraunce of their duties, towardes ſuch as had preached the Goſpel amongſt them. Whoſe faith they did imitate: bicauſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:9612:85"/> they had ſéene their conſtancie in contynuall preaching of ſounde doctrine,<note place="margin">Another ſhift that Watſon vſeth.</note> leading a lyfe according to the ſame. And here I muſt tell you, that you doe to much abuſe Saint Paule, when you make the Engliſhe reader beléeue, that ſaint Paule ſpeaketh in the Imparatiue Moode, commaunding the Hebrues to folow the fayth of thoſe men, the ende of whoſe conuerſation they had ſéene. For both in the Gréeke and Latine, it is the Indicatiue Moode. You doe folow. But graunt it be a marke whereby the ſoundneſſe of fayth maye be knowne: What haue you wonne therby? Shall there not as many of the Popes Clergie be found inconſtaunt in doctrine: as of the teachers of the newe learning (as you terme them)? I néede not to write any more of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The worlde ſéeth well ynough, both the conſtauncie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of the moſt part of the teachers of your ſort.</p>
            <p>In déede (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith héere) when men ſhal ſée that the Preachers of any doctrine, doe perſeuer and continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunt in that doctrine, and doe leade a lyfe lyke vnto the doctrine: it moueth them that heare the doctrine, to waighe and conſider, both the lyfe and the doctrine, and when they finde that both be ſound,<note place="margin">The fruit of conſtancy and good lyfe in Preachers.</note> &amp; without hypocriſie, to folow the faith of ſuch preachers, as the Hebrues did folow the faith of them that had conſtauntly preached the worde amongſt them, and led a lyfe according to the ſame. But if the doctrine, when it is weighed, be found dyuers and ſtraunge, and the conuerſation hypocriticall, full of will workes, beſides, yea and contrarie to the commaundement of God: then the godly, wiſe, will leaue thoſe hypocrits and their faith, and ſéeke for ſuch as ſhall preach vnto them ſuch doctrine as may be found perfite and ſounde. And though the preachers of that doctrine doe in ſome pointes, ſhewe themſelues to be men: yet will they not reiect the ſounde doctrine, for the lack of ſounde lyfe in the preacher.</p>
            <p>But you bende theſe wordes of Paule another way: and you ſay that you haue ſéene the ende of this newe learning. It is (ſay you) carnall and deteſtable lyuing, conſpiracie and treaſon. Me thinketh, I could geſſe, where you learned to call the lyfe of thoſe teachers that you name newe: carnall and beaſtly. For it was
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9612:85"/> the maner of your olde mayſter Stephane Gardiner: ſo to terme the lyfe of maried miniſters. So beaſtly was he, and ſo beaſtly doe you ſéeme to be (for that is the carnall and beaſtly life that you meane, I am ſure) as to accompt that thing beaſtly, which is the holy ordinaunce of God. Saint Paule, euen in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that you doe cite hath ſayde. <hi>Honorabile eſt coniugium in omnibus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; thorus immaculatus.</hi> Mariage is honorable amongſt al men: and the bed thereof vndefiled. It is to much therefore to call it beaſtly in miniſters, for they be men alſo, and therefore their wedlock is honorable. As for your wyfeleſſe Prieſthood, the world hath ſéene and perceyued well ynough, and as ſaint Paule wryteth to the Epheſians. <hi>Quae enim in occulto fiune ab ipſis, turpe eſt &amp; dicere:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.</note> It is a filthye thing, once to name thoſe thinges that theſe men doe in ſecret.</p>
            <p>As for your conſpiracie and treaſon that you charge vs with: I referre to the iudgement of ſuch as haue reade the Chronicles and hiſtories of the practiſes of Popiſh Prelates. And I pray you (M. <hi>Watſon</hi>) euen in the dayes that you haue lyued: who haue bene the conſpirators and Traytors? Was <hi>Aſke</hi> in Lyncolne ſhire, a ſcholer of the new teachers? did not he and his companie, trayterouſly conſpire and rebell againſt their prince,<note place="margin">The fruits of popiſhe doctrine.</note> bicauſe their Pilgrimages and Abbayes were ſuppreſſed? And what ſay you to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Vicare of Loweth that ſturred about the ſame matter? And in king Edwarde the ſixt dayes: who were the Captaynes and leaders, in euery part of England almoſt, euen in one Sommer, but popiſhe prieſtes, and ſuch as had bene taught by them? And what Countries in all Englande were more quiet at that time, then were thoſe, where the goſpell (which you call new learning) had bene moſt diligently and faithfully taught?</p>
            <p>If you can name vs one, that being a teacher of the newe learning (as you terme it) hath rebelled againſt his prince: we can finde you a doſen of your Clearks for that one. And then are we in as good caſe being compared vnto you: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles were, being compared to the phariſeis. For if one in euery twelfe of vs, ſhould be founde to beare a trayterous hart towardes his prince, as among the twelue Apoſtles: there was founde one <hi>Iudas:</hi> yet
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:9612:86"/> ſhould we alwayes haue a .xj. honeſt men for one knaue, where as amongſt the Phariſeis and you, there are to be found for euery honeſt man a .xj. falſe knaues at the leaſt. And thus all men may ſée the ende of that learning that you call olde.</p>
            <p>Nowe, thoſe fathers whome the worlde was not worthye to haue: were not the teachers that you learned your Popiſhe fayth of: but you learned of thoſe fathers that were not worthy to haue the worlde. They were not fathers diſcended of the right line, but intruders and vſurpers, that moſt cruelly murdered the children of the right fathers.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Petr.</hi> 2.</note> And they are euen thoſe lying may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that ſaint Peter ſpake of in the place that you cite. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And you and your ſort, are euen the ſame that ſaint Iohn gyueth vs warning of in the place that you alledge? For you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did teach:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </note> but contrarie to that doctrine, you make to your ſelfe an head and mayſter vpon earth, and call him the moſt holy father, teaching his decrées and ordinaunces, as the doctrine that all Chriſts flock, muſt vnder paine of the loſſe both of body &amp; ſoule imbrace &amp; obey.</p>
            <p>And here ſaint Iohn doth teache vs to auoyde you and your ſort, which doe teach &amp; profeſſe another doctrine, then that which was by the Prophets and Apoſtles taught, to be beléeued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued of all Gods elected and choſen children throughout the worlde. This doctrine is not the doctrine of the Papiſtes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Watſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth with a lowde lye.</note>But nowe you conclude with a lowde and ſhameleſſe lye: Affirming that your learning (meaning the Pops learning) hath vniuerſally preuayled, euer ſince the aſcenſion of Chriſt. Biſhop <hi>Iewell,</hi> in his aunſwere to your friend maiſter Doctor <hi>Harding:</hi> hath moſt manifeſtly proued, that you ſtretch your lye to farre by ſixe hundred yeres at the leaſt. And how haue you folowed the worde of the Lorde God, to whome you turne your ſpéeche and ſay, if we be diſceyued, thou haſt diſceyued vs: ſeing he ſayth, drinke ye all of this, and you ſay, No. None ſhall drinke it but Prieſts onely. Make thée no grauen Image (ſayth he) yes (ſay you) we will haue our Churches full. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if God haue diſceyued you: it is not bicauſe you haue beléeued his worde: but bicauſe you haue loued lyes more
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9612:86"/> then truth, and therefore God hath iuſtly giuen you ouer <hi>In effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam erroris,</hi> euen to the force and ſtrength of error,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2.</note> as ſaint Paule wryteth. And ſo is your error a iuſt puniſhment for the credite that you gaue vnto lyes. And although God neyther doth nor can diſceyue any man, in ſuch ſort as you doe meane: yet he ſayth that in ſuch meaning as I haue written,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14.</note> he doth diſceyue ſuch as you are, for the wickedneſſe of ſuch people as you haue inſtructed.</p>

               <hi>By this accuſation we may vnderſtand, that our ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and miſteries in the beginning of the Church were kept very ſecret, both from the ſight and knowledge of the Paganes that mocked and ſcorned them, and alſo of thoſe that were <hi>Catechumini,</hi> learners of our fayth and not yet bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, for many great cauſes which I ſhall not neede to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe nowe. And yet for all the ſecret keping of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many Chriſten men and women as there was, they could not be kept ſo ſecret, but that ſome ynkeling of them came to the eares of thoſe that were Infidels and vnchriſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, inſomuch that where as in deede and verie truth by the rules of our religion, we did eate the fleſhe of Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde, and drinke hys bloud miniſtred vnto vs in the ſacrament, the Gentiles as they were curious to know new things, ſo they came to knowledge of the rumour of our
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:9612:87"/> doings, &amp; eyther by the bewraying of ſome falſe brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or elſe by the ſimplicity of other, that of zeale without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge would haue conuerted the vnfaythfull to our fayth, heard ſecretly, that wee chriſten men in our miſteries did eate mans fleſh and drinke mans bloud, which they for lack of faith, and further inſtruction began to compaſſe in their wittes, how it was poſsible ſo to doe, and therefore ſome of them blinded by their owne fooliſhe ſuſpicion conceaued and publiſhed amongſt other, as it was moſt likely vnto them, that we in our ſecret miſterie, did kill yong children, eating their fleſh, and drinking their bloud, and therevpon accuſed certayne before the Magiſtrates of thys heynous crime, which they coulde neuer trie out to be true, as they did accuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for our purpoſe it appeareth plainly, that we would neuer haue kept our miſteries ſo ſecret, if they had beene but ceremonies of eating of bread &amp; wine, nor they would neuer haue accuſed vs of ſuch beaſtly and vnnatural crimes being men of ſuch reaſon, learning and equity, as they were, if there had not bene ſome truth in their accuſation, which in deede was true for the ſubſtaunce of that they alledged, but not for the maner of the thing: for it was and is true, that we in our miſteries eate fleſhe and drinke bloud, but yet we doe not kill and murder yong children, and eate their fleſh and drinke their bloud. And therfore I alledge the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Tertullian and Euſebius, the which is alſo in Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen the ſixt booke <hi>contra Celſum,</hi> to declare the accuſation of the Gentils againſt vs, concerning the eating of fleſhe, and drinking of bloud, which could neuer haue commed into their heads ſo to haue done, if there had not bene a truth in that matter, which they by their reaſon could neuer ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then they alleged, which we by our faith do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee and know as it was ordeined by Chriſt our Lord. And for that cauſe Tertullian did caſt in a vaine worde, ſaying: that we were accuſed of the ſacrament of kylling of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which worde (Sacrament) ſtandeth there for no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:9612:88"/> but to declare vnto vs, that this their accuſation did riſe for lack of the true and preciſe knowledge of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which is true, concerning the eating of fleſhe and drinking of bloud, but not true concerning the kylling and murdering of children.</hi>

Beholde, this that you doe is to eate men. Why doe ye ſearche for amongſt vs, as for an horrible déede done in ſecret, that thing which you your ſelues doe commit in the open light. For we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eate men, nor doe any other euill thing.</p>
            <p>Of theſe two places you gather a coniecture, that is, that for as much as, the chriſtians were accuſed, as eaters of mans fleſhe and drinkers of mans bloud: there muſt néedes be ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that accuſation. Which you can coniecture to be none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the common opinion of the chriſtians, concerning the ſubſtaunce that they receyued in the ſacrament. Which though they kept as ſecretly as poſſibly they might: yet by one meane or other, it came to the eares of the enimies of Chriſten profeſſion. Which for lack of fayth could not conceyue that maner of eating fleſhe and drinking bloud that the chriſtians vſed. And therfore they bruted abroad their owne fooliſhe coniecture: Which was, that chriſtians did in their ſacrifice kill a yong Infant, and dip there ſacrificing bread in the bloud therof, and ſo eate it. But you after your maner of amplifying, doe ſay, that the chriſtians were accuſed before certaine Magiſtrates, of this heynous crime of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the fleſhe of yong children and drinking their bloud. Which you can finde neyther in <hi>Tertullian</hi> nor <hi>Euſebius.</hi> But ſo your tale hath a better ſhewe for your purpoſe: that you might
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:9612:89"/> conclude, that it could neuer haue come into the heades of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, thus to accuſe the chriſtians, if there had not bene a truth in the matter. And therefore you conclude that it is true that in thoſe dayes the chriſtians did, and we doe nowe, eate fleſhe and drinke bloud in the ſacrament, but not true concerning the kyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and murdering of children. This you ſay is the weakeſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that you will vſe, to proue and conuince the truth of your fayth by.</p>
            <p>If this argument be ſufficient to proue and conuince that we doe eate the fleſh and drinke the bloud of Chriſt, in the ſacrament, after your ſort: then let me make an argument to proue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, that in <hi>Tertullians</hi> dayes, chriſtians did giue themſelues to carnall copulation, eyther in common, or elſe at the leaſt with their owne wyfes, immediatly after their feaſt of communion, euen in the ſame place where they had holden that feaſt. For <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſayth immediatly after thoſe wordes that you cite.<note place="margin">An argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t like Watſons.</note> 
               <hi>Et poſt conuiuium inceſto, quòd euerſores luminum canes, lenones ſilicet, tenebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; libidinum impiarum inuerecundiam procurent.</hi> And it is ſayde that after the feaſt, we go to inceſt, and that Dogs, that is to ſay, Bawds, which ouerthrow the lightes, doe procure vnſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the darkeneſſe and wicked luſtes. Thus they doe report of vs, ſayth <hi>Tertullian.</hi> But this ſuſpition coulde neuer haue come into their heades if there had not béene a truth in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of carnall copulation, although not inceſtuouſly as they did maliciouſly brute abroad.</p>
            <p>As well doth this argument proue and conuince this matter, as doth your argument proue that chriſtians did in thoſe dayes and doe nowe, eate fleſhe and drinke bloud in the ſacrament. I can not but maruaile what you meane in cyting <hi>Origine contra Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum:</hi> ſith you haue ſayde before, that the accuſers of the chriſtians were men of great reaſon, learning and equitie.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:9612:89"/> ſuch abhominable and ſlaunderous reportes.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath caſt in a worde, that maketh vp the matter, whole on your ſide. For he ſayth <hi>De ſacramento inſanticidij.</hi> For the ſacrament of kylling of children.

            <p>This word ſacrament (you ſay) is a vayne worde, and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth there, for no purpoſe, but to declare vnto vs, that their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did riſe, for lack of the true and preciſe knowledge of oure ſacrament.</p>
            <p>If I might be ſo bolde, I would tell you, that your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Tertullians</hi> wryting is verie vaine and fooliſhe, in that you iudge him to haue caſt in this worde ſacrament, as ſeruing to none other purpoſe but as you imagine. For what is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, then that the heathen did report of them that they had a myſterie or ſacrament, which did conſiſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murdering of yong children? And doth not <hi>Rhenanus,</hi> in the argument of this booke, ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was obiected to the chriſtians, that in their diuine ſeruice, they did kill a yong Infant, and imbrue with his bloud, the bread that they would eate. But this was falſe ſayth he. But you ſaye it was true concerning the ſubſtaunce of the matter.

I muſt néeds ſay then, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue, miſconſter, &amp; enforce the wrytings of the auncient fathers, to ſerue your purpoſe.

               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:9612:90"/> ſauing that then you might not haue tranſlated it as you doe. But you muſt néedes haue ſayde the foode of <hi>Iudas.</hi> And why might not the enimies obiect to the Chriſtians theſe thrée crimes: The kylling of Infants.

            <p>You ſay, that the Chriſtians kept their myſteries ſo ſecret: that the enimies could haue no knowledge of the maner of their doings.

            <p>By this it is manifeſt that the Chriſtians did not in thoſe dayes, kéepe their myſteries ſo ſecret, as you would haue men thinke they did.<note place="margin">Watſons concluſion foloweth not.</note> Neither doth that folow that you would conclude, that is, that bicauſe the enimies to chriſtian religion, did imagine that they did murder Infants, and embrue the bread that they ſhould eate in their communion, with the bloud of thoſe children: therefore it was true, that they did eate the fleſhe and drinke the bloud of Chriſt in the ſacrament, in ſuch reall and carnall ſort as you teache.</p>

            <p>And where you ſay that adoration hath bene done to the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments euen from the beginning: you ſhall neuer be able to proue it, for the teſtimonie of the heathen that you ſtick vnto, is diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

But we confeſſe, that Chriſt is receyued of the worthy receyuer, although not carnally as you teach.</p>
            <p>Yea, we ſay with <hi>Auſten</hi> in that ſame place that you doe cite. <hi>Noſter autem Panis &amp; Calix non quilibet, quaſi propter Chriſtum in ſpicis &amp; ſarmentis ligatum, ſicut illi deſipiunt: ſed certa conſecratione, myſticus fit nobis, non naſcitur. &amp;c.</hi> Our bread and cup be not of the common ſort, as in ſtéede of Chriſt bound togither in eares of corne and twigs, as they (that is, the <hi>Manichies</hi>) doe fooliſhly imagine: but by vndoubted conſecration, it is made vnto vs, myſticall or ſacramentall bread, it doth not growe ſuch, wherefore that foode that is not ſo made, although it be bread and wine: it is a nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of refection, but not a ſacrament of religion, otherwiſe then that we bleſſe and giue thankes to God in all his giftes, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirituall, but corporall alſo.</p>

            <p>Firſt, I muſt tell you, that you haue enforced <hi>Baſill</hi> to ſpeake otherwiſe in Engliſhe thorowe your lippes: then eyther he wrote in Greeke: or his tranſlatour, in Latine.

            <p>
               <hi>Iſychius</hi> expounding the <hi>.22.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things declare what is ment by the eating of holye things by ignoraunce.

            <p>Of what antiquitie this <hi>Iſychius</hi> was, and how worthy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite his writings are. I finde none ſo good teſtimony, as in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Tritemius,</hi> ſometime Abbot of <hi>Spanheimens,</hi> who ſaith that he hath read this worke of his. He himſelfe in the preface of his booke, ſayth, that of neceſſitie the interpretation muſt be drawne to the <hi>Anagogicall</hi> ſenſe. Whereby it is manifeſt, that his opinion was, that ſuch places of the booke that he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde,<note place="margin">Iſychius to much giuen to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogical ſenſe.</note> as had any difficultie in the litterall ſenſe: muſt be ſo drawne to the <hi>Anagogicall</hi> ſenſe, as though there were no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſenſe to be obſerued in them. Which is contrarie to the rule of all good interpretours, whoſe care is alwayes to haue an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regarde to the letter. Whereof this common ſaying ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth. <hi>Maledicta gloſsa quae corrumpit textum.</hi> Curſſed is the gloſſe, that doth corrupt the text. And that it may appéere that he is of that minde in déede: conſider his wordes which are written not much before that which you doe cite, where he ſaith thus. <hi>Quomodo cius quod iam comedit &amp; conſumpſit, addere quis quintam poteſt:</hi> How is any man able, to adde the fift part of that thing, which he hath
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:9612:94"/> alreadie eaten and conſumed? In theſe wordes, he ſhoweth him ſelfe to be within the reach of that curſſe that ſaint <hi>Hierome</hi> doth pronounce, vpon all them that ſay that God hath commaunded any thing to be done, which is not poſſible to be done. Yea he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth himſelfe to be a man of very ſmall diſcretion: that could not conceyue howe this commaundement might be fulfilled after the letter. For what is more playne then to ſay? He that eateth fiue apples of another mans: ſhall adde a fift part, and giue the ſame to him that ought the fiue apples that he hath eaten. Will anye wiſe man ſay, that it is not poſſible ſo to doe, bicauſe he hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die eaten and conſumed the fiue apples? I thinke not. But euery wiſe man wil ſay: This man that hath eaten his neighbours fiue apples: muſt take ſo many of the ſame kinde and goodneſſe that the other which he hath eaten were, and adde therevnto one of the ſame kinde and goodneſſe alſo: and then giue thoſe ſixe apples to him that ought thoſe that he hath eaten. And why may not <hi>Moſes</hi> wordes be ſo vnderſtanded, when he ſayth. <hi>Addet quintam partem cum eo quod comedit?</hi> He ſhall adde the fift part, with that which he hath eaten? It may be that this <hi>Iſychius</hi> of yours was ſome great Clearke: but ſurely, he hath not in this point ſhewed himſelfe to be the wiſeſt man.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Anagogicall</hi> ſenſe that he doth gather vpon this place: I doe not miſlike. I ſuppoſe that it may well be ſayde, that thoſe men doe eate the holy things by ignoraunce, that doe receiue the miſterie or ſacrament of Chriſtes body, not knowing the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and vertue thereof. And where he ſayth, that the fift part that muſt be added, is the wordes that Chriſt ſpake ouer the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries: I can not but allowe it to be a good <hi>Anagogicall</hi> ſenſe. For that worde doth deliuer vs from ignoraunce, and maketh vs to vnderſtande, that thoſe creatures are not nowe to be vſed and conſidered, as when we take them for the ſuſtentation of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: but as myſteries, and therefore thoſe wordes doe remoue vs from the carnall and earthy conſideration of them, to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them that is heauenly.</p>
            <p>Thus doe I lyke verie well with your <hi>Iſychius</hi> for his <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge.</hi> And whether he were the hearer of <hi>Cregorie Nazianzen</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:9612:95"/> or not: I force not.

For, the verie ſame <hi>Anagoge</hi> is there, and yet not cited out of <hi>Iſychius.</hi> And you know that, that Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, doth alwayes note the names of thoſe auncient fathers that miniſter him any matter.</p>
            <p>But the concluſion that you make vpon <hi>Iſychius</hi> wordes: I vtterly miſlike. And I ſuppoſe, that <hi>Iſychius</hi> himſelfe, if he were lyuing, could not lyke well with you, for abuſing his worde to ſuch a purpoſe.

            <p>Here you ſée what luck you haue, when you aduaunce the authoritie of obſcure matter, by cyting the ſame vnder the names of ſuch as be famous. No man can ſpeake more playnely againſt you, then this man doth in this place.</p>
            <p>But what though he had not written this, but had written only of this matter, in ſuch ſort as you haue cyted his wordes, and were of as great authority as euer was <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> what had you wonne by his wordes, when they be taken whole togither? I will therefore adde thoſe wordes that you leaue out: that the indifferent reader may iudge. <hi>Quoniam hoc non ſolum datur: quod vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur, ſed etiam illud quod intelligitur.</hi> So that his words togither are thus much. That thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prieſt doth deliuer out of his hande, is not only ſanctified, but it is ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: bicauſe, not only that which is ſéene is delyuered, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing that is vnderſtanded alſo.</p>
            <p>We graunt, that the thing ſignified and vnderſtanded by the ſacrament, is delyuered by the miniſter, and receyued by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuer that is a member of Chriſt: but not in ſuch ſort as you holde. Sacramentally and ſpiritually, the thing that is ſignified and vnderſtanded is giuen and receyued, as I haue before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Theſe words therfore, taken togither &amp; rightly weighed, doe make nothing againſt vs, but rather with vs, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that we neyther drawe them to the figuratiue maner of ſpeaking, nor yet depraue the words or meaning of the writer.</p>
            <p>But a perillous point of ſophiſtrie, you thinke méete to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſome what opened to your auditorie. Children at the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie can tell: that to exclude a ſpeciall and ſinguler definition,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:9612:96"/> by a generall diſcription, is a deceitfull way of reaſoning.</p>
            <p>It is commonly ſéene that ſuch as doe vſe to digge pits for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fall into: doe fall into the ſame themſelues firſt of al. Your purpoſe was, by preferring the knowledge of children in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, before the knowledge of your betters in learning, which were Biſhops in king Edwarde the ſixt dayes:<note place="margin">Watſon going about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face other, is defaced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> vtterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face thoſe learned fathers, and to bring them out of credite, as men that knew not ſo much, as children in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vniuerſity do knowe And ſo to extoll your owne knowledge aboue the ſtarres. For you are none of the babes at the vniuerſitie. But when your wordes ſhall be well weighed: they ſhall be found more babiſhe and fooliſhe, then commonly can be founde among the children at the vniuerſitie.</p>
            <p>A ſpeciall and ſinguler definition (you ſay) is excluded by a generall deſcription. A childe at the vniuerſitie would aſke you: what maner of definition that is, which you call ſpeciall and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler. And in whoſe Logick he might learne to know that defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Logitians that hither to haue written: haue made no mention of any ſuch definition. <hi>Boetius</hi> maketh mention of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſortes of definitions: but of this that you ſpeake of, he maketh no mention at all. Commonly, the authors write but of foure ſortes of definitions. One <hi>Eſſentiall,</hi> another <hi>Cauſall,</hi> the thirde <hi>Integrall,</hi> and the fourth <hi>Accidentall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides this the children might aſke you: howe ſpeciall and ſinguler, may in Logicall matter, be both verified of one thing, in one and the ſame reſpect, and at one time, as you doe here vſe them. Thoſe therefore, whome (in deriſion) you call no ſmall men, but your greateſt Biſhops: if they were nowe lyuing, would make the worlde ſée, that for your good knowledge in Logick,<note place="margin">A worthye promotion.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you ſhew in this Sermon: you might leaue the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines Chayre, and ſet you downe amongſt the babling Sophiſts agayne, till you had gotten you better ſkill in Logick.</p>
            <p>The generall deſcription of conſecration, that thoſe men did receyue, ſhall be found as good a definition of the ſame: as you or any of your ſort ſhall be able to make. The conſecration that thoſe men receyued, is that benediction and decrée of Chriſt:
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:9612:96"/> wherby the viſible ſignes are appointed to an holy vſe. We ſpeak not of your generall conſecration, whereby the heathen and you Papiſtes, haue without any warant of the worde of God, yea, contrarie to Gods word, conſecrated ſo many of Gods creatures to Idoles and Idole ſeruice: but we ſpeake of conſecration that Chriſt himſelfe hath made &amp; doth ſtill make, as oft as his Church and congregation, doe take his creatures, and vſe them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his commaundement, to repreſent vnto their ſenſes, thoſe inuiſible graces that he hath appointed thoſe creatures to ſignifie to vs.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth here compare the wordes that Chriſt

            <p>And where as you ſay, that ſome of vs haue ſayde, that euery man and woman may conſecrate: you muſt name them that haue ſo ſaid, or cite the words y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch haue written, elſe wil men ſay that you doe belye vs, &amp; that you might well haue ſpared the wordes of <hi>Arnobius,</hi> which you do cite, affirming y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we did neuer read them.</p>
            <p>But whether we haue read the wordes of <hi>Arnobius</hi> or not: it may ſéeme that you did neuer vnderſtand them. For if you had, you would not haue tranſlated, ſo, and then: for ſo, and as, nor conſecrate for <hi>conficere.</hi> But you would haue ſayde: What is ſo excellent: as to go thorowe with the miniſtration of Gods ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? And what is ſo pernicious, as if the ſame be done, by that man that hath taken no degrée of prieſthood?</p>
            <p>The purpoſe of <hi>Arnobius</hi> in this place, is to proue, that the preſumption to doe contrarie to Gods commaundement:<note place="margin">The fruites of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is it that maketh the actions of men, which otherwiſe are good, to be excéeding euill. For what (ſayth he) is ſo holy a thing, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the communion of Chriſt? And what is ſo wicked, as if one that is not baptiſed receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. And what can be more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, then that a man that is not called to the office of miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſhould take vpon him to miniſter the ſacraments of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>I thinke you be not able to proue, that any of vs hath eyther ſpoken or written to the contrarie of that which <hi>Arnobius</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in this place. You can not therefore iuſtly ſay, that we doe erre, eyther in the time or perſon. For we holde, that when the congregation of Chriſt aſſembled togither, doe by the mouth of

For I ſuppoſe that ſuch as be yet but learners of chriſten religion: are after a certain peculiar maner ſanctified, by the ſigne of Chriſt, &amp; the prayer of the laying on of handes. And that thing which they doe receyue, although it be not the body of Chriſt: yet it is holy, &amp; more holy, then is the meat that we are fed withall, bicauſe it is a ſacrament: The ſame Apoſtle alſo hath ſayde, that the verie meates where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are fed for the neceſſitie of the ſuſtayning of thys lyfe: are ſanctified by the worde of God and prayer, which we vſe when we are about to refreſhe our bodies.</p>
            <p>Here, let the indifferent reader iudge, howe faythfully you haue handled this place of <hi>Auſten.</hi> Firſt, you leaue out the firſt part of the ſentence, that might giue light to the vnderſtanding of <hi>Auſtens</hi> meaning. And where <hi>Auſten</hi> ſheweth, that the thing that the learners of chriſtian religion doe receyue, is holy, bicauſe it is a ſacrament: you paſſe ouer that,<note place="margin">A homely ſhift.</note> with other wordes that might ſounde ſomewhat againſt your purpoſe, and knit vp the matter with theſe wordes: which alſo is ſanctified by the worde and prayer. And make your hearers thinke that your maner of dealing holy bread was vſed in ſaint <hi>Auſtens</hi> time: you tranſlate this worde <hi>Quod.</hi> Holy bread.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Auſtens</hi> meaning, is to declare, that as there is holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in creatures, by ſuch meanes as God hath appointed for the ſanctifying of his creatures: ſo is not their holyneſſe alyke, but one is more holy then another. The learners of Chriſten religion were holy:<note place="margin">Degrees of holyneſſes.</note> yet not ſo holy as were thoſe that being fully inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were baptiſed. So, the bread, which they receyued, in token
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:9612:98"/> of the loue that thoſe which were alreadie baptiſed, did beare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them, was holy (for as ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> ſayth, it was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that is, an holy ſigne) yet was it not ſo holy, as that ſacramentall bread, which chriſtians did according to Chriſtes inſtitution, deuide amongſt them. And yet it was more holy then the common bread that is made holy when we praye before we take it for the ſuſtinaunce of our bodies.</p>
            <p>The other holyneſſes alſo that you ſpeake of, we denie not. Neyther doe we denie that the ſacraments of God be holy,<note place="margin">Watſon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth that before he did builde.</note> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be inſtruments. &amp;c. But here I muſt note, that you doe in this place, ouerthrow, that which you haue ſo greatly laboured to builde. For you doe here make the ſacraments, but as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſes of holyneſſe: where as you haue before ſtoutly affirmed, that they be in déede: the efficient cauſes of wonderfull holy effectes.</p>
            <p>But as one that had ouerſlipt himſelfe: you correct your ſelfe ſomewhat ſubtilly, affirming that aboue all, the ſacrament of the aultar is holy. &amp;c.

For (ſay you) whatſoeuer thing is in God: is God alſo.

            <p>But let vs ſée, what it is, that you read in <hi>Hierome</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It ſéemeth to me, that you haue read in thoſe Authors: that which you vnderſtand not.

               <note place="margin">Watſons Paradox.</note> as you would by their words enforce vs to beléeue? That is, that Chriſt did eate his owne fleſhe, and drinke his owne bloud. In the aunſwere that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> made to the ſecond queſtion that <hi>Hedibia</hi> deſired to be reſolued in: he ſayth thus. <hi>Nec Moſes dedit nobis panem verum, ſed Dominus Ieſus: ipſe conuiua &amp; conuiuium: ipſe comedens, &amp; qui comeditur.</hi> Moſes gaue vs not the true bread, but the Lorde Ieſus: He is the Gueſt, and the feaſt alſo. It is he that doth eate and is eaten. But is here all that <hi>Hierome</hi> writeth in this aunſwere? Doth he leaue the matter ſo doubtfull, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to make it plaine? I trow not. He ſaith that we doe drink the bloud of Chriſt, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without Chriſt we can not drink it. And
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:9612:101"/> that we doe daylie in his ſacrifices, treade out new red wine, out of the generation of the true vine, and the elected and choſen vine: and that thereof we doe drinke newe wine in the kingdome of his father, not in the oldneſſe of the letter, but in the neweneſſe of the ſpirit, ſinging a new ſong, that none is able to ſing, except ſuch as be in the kingdome of the Church, which is the kingdome of the father. This bread did the Patriarck <hi>Iacob</hi> deſire to eate, ſaying: If the Lorde God ſhall be with me, and ſhall giue me bread to eate, and apparell to couer me withall. And then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth his aunſwere with theſe wordes. <hi>Quotquot autem in Chriſto baptizamur: Chriſtum induimus, &amp; panem comedimus Angelorum, &amp; audimus Dominum praedicantem, Meus cibus eſt, vt faciam voluntatem eius qui miſit me Patris, vt impleam opus eius.

My meat, is to doe the wil of that father that hath ſent me, that I may fulfill his worke, let vs therfore doe the will of that father that hath ſent vs: and let vs fulfill his worke, and Chriſt will drinke his owne bloud with vs in the kingdome of the Church.</p>
            <p>Now, if you be not obſtinate, you muſt néedes confeſſe, that <hi>Hierome</hi> meaneth nothing leſſe then to teach that Chriſt did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch ſort as you holde: eate his owne fleſhe and drinke his owne bloud. But that he did it, by doing the will of his father, and performing his worke.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> alſo (if you would vnderſtand his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aright) would teache you another meaning of Chriſtes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then that which you gather. His words be theſe.<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Math. ho. <hi>83.</hi>

He himſelfe alſo did drinke of the ſame, leaſt they hearing thoſe wordes ſhould ſay. What? doe we drinke bloud and eate fleſhe? And ſhould therfore be troubled in minde. For euen when he did before ſpeake of thoſe things: many were offended, euen for the wordes onely. Leaſt the ſame thing therefore, ſhould happen then alſo: he did it firſt himſelfe: that he might enduce them to be
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:9612:102"/> partakers of the myſteries with a quiet minde. But what? Will you ſay, that the olde paſſouer was able to doe this alſo? No. For he ſayde doe this: that he might leade them away from that. Furthermore, if this paſſouer doe worke remiſſion of ſinnes, as it doth in déede: then is the other vtterly of none effect. But euen as in the olde paſſouer, ſo in lyke maner here: he hath left vs a benefit by gathering togither the memorie of the myſteries, and therby bridling y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouths of the heretiks. For when they ſay, how doth it appéere that Chriſt was offred, and many other miſteries: then we alledging theſe things do ſtop their mouths. For if Ieſus did not die: whoſe pledge and ſigne, is this ſacrifice? Thus you ſée, what great care he had, that we ſhould alwaies kepe in memory: that he died for vs. Thus far <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in the place y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you cite.</p>
            <p>Here it is manifeſt that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> goeth not about in this place, to teache that Chriſt did drinke his owne bloud: but that he did drinke of the Cup of the newe paſſouer (whiche he called his bloud, as the Lambe was called the paſſouer) that his Apoſtles might not haue occaſion to thinke ſo groſſely as you teache. That is, that he hadde turned the ſubſtaunce of the Wine into the ſubſtaunce of his bloud,<note place="margin">The purpoſe of Chriſt in drinking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> and woulde giue it them to drinke, contrarie to the lawe, which did forbid them the eating of any thing in the bloud therof. But he did drinke therof before them: that they might thereby know, that it was not bloud but wine, which he would haue them to drinke in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of his death and bloud ſhedding, as the paſſouer was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the remembraunce of the peoples deliueraunce in Egypt. And further to bring them from the obſeruing of the old paſſouer, which was ended in him. And to arme them againſt thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, that would deny that Chriſt died for the ſinnes of the world. That this is <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> minde, doth plainely appéere in thoſe wordes of his, that I haue before written: taken out of the ſame Chapter that you cite. As for his maner of ſpeaking in calling the wine his bloud: I haue ſufficiently written, in the former part of this aunſwere.</p>
            <p>It is playne therefore, that you doe open wrong to <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> in that you would enforce him to help you to maintaine
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:9612:102"/> your ſtraunge <hi>Paradox</hi> of Chriſtes eating of his owne fleſhe and drinking of his owne bloud, which I ſuppoſe neuer any learned or wiſe man, would maintaine as you doe.</p>
            <p>As for the wordes that you cite out of <hi>Euthymius</hi> and <hi>Iſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> are ſufficiently aunſwered in this that I haue written for aunſwere to that which you haue cited out of <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> For they both ſéeme to haue taken out of him, all that they write of this matter.</p>

But thou art oftentimes offended, at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of the iniuries that be paſt: but this man, although he might ſtande in feare of thoſe things that were to come, knowing for certaintie that if he would ſaue his enimie, he ſhould both be baniſhed the Citie, and lead a poore and miſerable lyfe: yet did he not leaue of to be carefull for him, but he did all things that might
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:9612:103"/> nouriſhe this ſo great an enimie. Who is able to tell vs of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter toleraunce or forbearing then this?</p>
            <p>If figuratiuely, and ſpiritually, may not be admitted in theſe wordes of <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> then let vs knowe, howe it can be truely ſaide of him, that he in his time, they that were before him and after Chriſtes aſcention, and thoſe that haue bene ſince, are now, and ſhal be to the worlds ende: haue ſéene or ſhal ſée Chriſts bloud poured out, and him crucified. I am ſure, you will not ſay, that all theſe vnder the new teſtament, haue ſéene or ſhal ſée with their bodily eyes, Chriſt crucified, and his bloud poured out.</p>
            <p>Well, then you muſt giue vs leaue to thinke, that <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> doth vſe here, that ſame figure that ſaint Iohn doth vſe in the beginning of his firſt Epiſtle. Where he ſayth thus.<note place="margin">Chryſoſtome vſeth the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole in extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Dauids toleraunce.</note> We declare vnto you, that thing that we haue ſéene with our eies. &amp;c. And why may we not vnderſtand <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> to vſe the ſame figure when he ſayth: that Dauid had not bene partaker of the Lordes bloud? And that it had not happened him to taſte of ſuche a ſacrifice. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There was none of the ſacrifices of the olde lawe, that did paint out Chriſt crucified ſo playnely, and ſet him out ſo liuely to our ſenſes, as this ſacrament doth: wherefore <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> might well and truely ſay (without any figure at all) that it had not hapned to Dauid, to taſte of ſuch a ſacrifice. Neyther did the lawe and prophets before Chriſt, ſo plainely and fully teache that higheſt point of chriſtian Philoſophie, which Dauid attayned vnto, as doth the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> might well write as he doth, that Dauid had not heard. &amp;c. And why might not <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſay then, that Dauid was brought vp vnder lawes that were ſomewhat vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfite, in compariſon of the lawe of the goſpell: although there be in the lawe it ſelfe, no imperfection at all? The lawe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, to the ende that God did appoint it for. That was to bring men to the knowledge of their ſinnes, and to driue them to Chriſt that was able to take away their ſinnes. And why may not <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in this place (according to the common cuſtome of the fathers) call the ſacrament, by the name of that thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:9612:104"/> it is a ſacrament?</p>
            <p>But here once agayne, I muſt tell you, that the verie wordes that you cite: are flatly againſt your halfe communion. And that if Dauid had bene a popiſhe prince: he ſhould neuer haue dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Lordes bloud, except he woulde haue bene a popiſhe Prieſt alſo.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:9612:111"/> ſée the wordes of <hi>Hilarie:</hi> as they ſtande written in his eyght booke <hi>De irinitate.</hi> And then let him iudge howe worthye credite you are, that ſhame not, to ſnatch ſuch péeces to proue your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He ſayth thus: <hi>Eos nunc qui inter Patrem &amp; filium, voluntatis ingerunt vnitatem: interrogo, vtrumne per naturae veritatem, bodie Chriſtus in nobis ſit, an per concordiam voluntatis? Si enim verè verbum caro fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt, &amp; nos verè verbum carnem cibo dominico ſumimus: quomodo non naturaliter manere in nobis ixiſtimandus est, qui &amp; naturam carnis noſtrae iam inſeparabilem ſibi homo natus aſſumpſit, &amp; naturam carnis ſuae, ad naturam aeternitatis, ſub ſacramento nobis communicandae carnis admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit.</hi> Nowe, I doe demaunde of them that doe caſt in, or heape vpon vs, the vnitie of wyll betwéene the father and the ſonne: whether at this day, Chriſt be in vs, by nature in déede, or by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréement of wyll? For if the ſonne of God be made fleſhe in déede, and we doe in the Lordes meat, receyue the ſonne of God incarnate in déede: how ſhould he be thought not to dwell natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in vs, which being borne a man, hath both taken vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the inſeparable nature of our fleſhe, and alſo hath myngled the nature of his fleſhe, with the nature of eternitie, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto vs vnder a ſacrament.</p>
            <p>If we ſhall vnderſtand all theſe words of <hi>Hilarie,</hi> ſo groſſely as you would haue vs to vnderſtand thoſe wordes that you cite: then ſhall <hi>Hilarie</hi> be found one of thoſe, that affirme the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt to be confounded, contrarie to that which all true chriſtians doe with <hi>Athanaſius</hi> confeſſe. For he ſaith, that Chriſt hath mingled the nature of his fleſhe, with the eternitie, that is, with the deuine nature. We muſt therefore reade his wordes with fauour: as I haue noted in that which I haue written vpon thoſe wordes that you cite out of him in the <hi>.24.</hi> deuiſion of this Sermon.<note place="margin">Loke in the 24. deuiſion.</note> Being earneſtly bent againſt thoſe heretikes that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the naturall vnitie betwixt Chriſt and his father: he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a great deale to largely of the vnitie betwixt Chriſt and vs, calling that naturall alſo. But for the wordes that you cite: we confeſſe all that <hi>Hilarie</hi> ſayth.

Of what authoritie this Maſſe of <hi>Baſill</hi> is: I referre to the iudgement of the learned. It is not, neyther hath bene folowed in any Church, neyther is it found in his workes in the Gréeke. Wherefore it ſéemeth to mée, to be but a deuiſe thruſt out in his name, by ſome one that was vnborne many yeres after <hi>Baſill</hi> was dead. But let it be of as great authority as you would wiſhe it to be: ſhall his wordes that you cite, proue the ſacrament to be the body and bloud of Chriſt, and neyther bread nor wine? He calleth it but an holy, godly, vndefiled, immortall, heauenly, and quickning ſacrament. If you adde a minor propoſition, and ſaye: but euery ſuch ſacrament is the reall, and naturall body of Chriſt: ſhall we be enforced to conclude, <hi>Ergo,</hi> this ſacrament is the reall and naturall body and bloud of Chriſt, and not ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bread or wine? I trow not. I dare referre this to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them that vnderſtande Art.</p>
            <p>But is there nothing in that Maſſe that maketh againſt you? I trowe he ſayth thus. <hi>Confidentes appropinquamus ſancto altari tuo, &amp; proponentes configuralia ſancti corporis &amp; ſanguinis Chriſti tui: te ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecramus, &amp; te poſtulamus ſaencte ſanctorum, beneplacita tua benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, venire ſpiritum ſanctum tuum ſuper nos, &amp; ſuper propoſita munera iſta, &amp; benedicere ea &amp; ſanctificare.</hi> Preſuming vpon thy mercies, we drawe nigh vnto thine aultar.

            <p>All theſe wordes, would your <hi>Baſill</hi> haue his high Prieſt to ſpeake, after the wordes of conſecration (as you terme them) wherby, as much as may be done in making the body and bloud of Chriſt, is done: and yet the holy ghoſt muſt come vpon thoſe gifts, and bleſſe and ſanctifie them yet more. When you haue weighed theſe wordes with the other, then tell me what you haue gayned towards your purpoſe. But when he commeth to the

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:9612:112"/> death. For the table is the ſtrength of our ſoule, the ſinewes of our minde, the bonde of our confidence or ſure truſt, our foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, hope, health, light, and our lyfe. It we ſhall depart hence, being armed with this ſacrifice: we ſhall with great boldneſſe aſcende vnto the holy entrie, as apparailed on euery ſide, wyth certaine garmentes of Golde. And why doe I ſpeake of things to come? For euen whylſt we be in this lyfe: this myſterie doth make the earth to be an heauen vnto vs. Go vp therefore to the gates of heauen: and marke diligently. Yea, not to the gates of heauen, but of the heauen of heauens: and then thou ſhalt behold thoſe things that we ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>Here you may ſée, what it is,<note place="margin">The ende of Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note> that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> mindeth to ſet forth by this elequence that he vſeth.

The Lordes ſupper, being rightly vſed of vs, doth lyuely ſet forth vnto vs (yea vnto oure ſenſes,) the Lorde Ieſus himſelfe, which is the ſtrength of oure ſoule, the ſinewes of our mind. &amp;c. This can we not liuely ſée, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we doe in ſpirit aſcend, to the gate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauen of heauens. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But when you will proue your purpoſe: then all that the fathers haue eyther written or ſpoken, to ſtirre vp their hearers or readers to heauenly contemplation: muſt néedes be playne ſpéeches, and applyed to prooue your groſſe opinion of the reall preſence of Chriſt in the ſacrament: They muſt néedes ſay that they neyther vſe figure, nor ſpirituall meaning.</p>
            <p>And where <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth in an other Homily call the ſacrament by theſe names, <hi>Rex Caeli, Deus,</hi>

               </hi> Whoſoeuer is not partaker of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries: is as a ſhameleſſe and wicked man, preſente at the miniſtration.</p>
            <p>But what ſhould I trouble the reader any longer in ſo plaine a matter? The fathers haue not diſceyued you by calling the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſt by ſo glorious and high names: but you haue diſceyued your ſelfe, by drawing their figuratiue and Rhetoricall maner of ſpéeches, to playne and grammaticall maners of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and their ſpirituall meanings, to your carnall and fleſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaning.</p>
            <p>And as you haue diſceyued your ſelues: ſo you and your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhe fathers haue laboured by the bragge of fiftene hundred yeres, to diſceyue all the whole chriſten worlde. For which you ſhall one day drinke of the cup of Gods wrath, except ye repent before ye depart henſe. Your, if, and your, but, will not ſerue you then. But as you ſay the errour is in your ſelfe, which woulde harken to the witleſſe ſophiſticall reaſoning of a fewe Popiſhe men, and ſo runne headlong to deſtroy your owne ſoules. Forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and not contynuing in that fayth that was taught by the mouth of Chriſt, ſealed with his bloud, and teſtified by the bloud of Martyrs: and hath preuailed from the beginning, and ſhall continue to the ende, in the diſpite of Antichriſt and all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and the whole power of hell.</p>
            <p>As for that which remayneth concerning the thirde point that cauſeth you to contynue in your Popiſhe fayth, that is the conſent of the Catholike Church (as you ſay) which to your great griefe you could not now for ſhortneſſe of time, go thorow with: ſhall be anſwered in the aunſwere to your other Sermon, if God wyll, I hope in ſuch ſort, that as many as be not wilfull blinde, ſhall ſée the ſubtiltie of your ſophiſtrie, and for euer after defie it, and your Popiſhe Maſſe alſo, which you boaſt to be ſo profitable to be frequented in the Church of Antichriſt, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your multituds of ydle belyes, in cloyſters and elſe where.</p>
            <p>And I doubt not, but whatſoeuer you or any other, hath or ſhall ſhoote againſt the right vſe of the Lordes ſupper, which is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:9612:113"/> nowe in reformed Churches frequented: ſhall to the glorie of almightie God rebounde into your owne boſomes, to the ſtaye of all ſuch as God in prouidence, hath appointed to be ſaued by the preaching of his worde. That they neuer encline to your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, but walke warily in the truth of the chriſtian religion, leading a chriſtian lyfe: that in the ende thereof, they may with Chriſt triumph ouer Antichriſt and all his Souldiours in endleſſe felicitie. Which he graunt to his elect and choſen children: that in hys ſonne Chriſt, knewe them, before they were. Amen.</p>

               <hi>Secondly, this conſent in this matter may appeare by that the holy fathers and paſtors of Chriſtes Church haue written of it, whome god hath placed and planted in hys Church for the buylding and vpholding of it in truth, that his flock be not ſeduced and caried about with euery blaſt of newe doctrine by the craftines of men, to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſoules.

            </p>
            <p>Nowe are you come to the firſt generall counſell,<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> holden at <hi>Nice,</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Bithinia,</hi> vnder <hi>Conſtantinus Magnus.</hi> In the <hi>.24.</hi> deuiſion of your former Sermon: I haue ſayde ſome thing to the later wordes of this ſentence that you cite out of the great general counſell of <hi>Nice.</hi> And in the <hi>.33.</hi> deuiſion of the ſame ſermon: I haue graunted as much, as the words y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you cite there doe teach, when they be vnderſtanded ſo, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auncient fathers do vſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like maner of ſpéeches. But here I muſt tell you that in the olde allowed counſell of <hi>Nice:</hi> there is no part of that which you rite here found written. Wherfore, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authority therof: muſt néeds be ſo much the leſſe. But graunt that the <hi>.318.</hi> Byſhops, had in that counſell agréed and written, euen as you haue cited: muſt we therfore beleue, that Chriſt is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrament in ſuch ſort as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9612:118"/> you teach, really and ſubſtantially. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Auſten,</hi> in his Sermon <hi>Ad Infantes,</hi> which is cyted by <hi>Beda,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Beda in <hi>1.</hi> Cor. ca. <hi>10.</hi>
               </note> ſayth thus. <hi>Vos eſtis in menſa, vos eſtis in Calice.</hi> You are vpon the table, you are in the Cup: ſhall we therefore ſaye, that ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> ment, that thoſe perſons that he ſpake vnto, were really, ſubſtantially and bodily, in the cup and on the table? I thinke you will not graunt it. And why will you by the wordes cyted out of the Nicene counſell, bind vs to beleue: that Chriſt is after ſuch ſort preſent in the ſacrament?</p>
            <p>As touching the maruellous touching (or couching) of the wordes (for ſo I ſuppoſe you ſpake) I can not but maruell, that you could not ſée, howe euerye one of them, ſerueth to expreſſe the truth againſt that which you teach. Firſt, they will vs to lift vp our mindes and to conſider by fayth, not things that are here conuerſaunt amongſt vs, and may be conceyued by bodily ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but that are aboue, and can not be conceyued otherwiſe then by fayth. Then they tell vs, that the Lambe of God is ſet vpon the holy table (euen as ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> telleth his Auditorie, that they are ſet vpon the table) to teach vs, that the ſacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt, is not a bare and naked ſigne, but ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to the worthye receyuer, that is to ſuch as beyng mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, are placed on the table and in the cup with Chriſt, in ſuch ſort as the Lambe of God is placed there, that is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and in a myſterie. And after the ſame ſort, the ſame Lambe is ſacrificed by the prieſtes: when by their miniſterie, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt be made partakers of that holy myſterie, and doe euen ſenſibly féele the effect of that ſacrifice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.10.</note> which that Lambe made of himſelfe once for all, as ſaint Paule wryteth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they declare, that we receyuing the precious body and bloud of Chriſt in déede: doe beléeue that it is the pledge of our reſurrection. Which maner of receyuing, it pleaſeth you to terme, a reall receyuing. As though the body of Chriſt coulde not be receyued by fayth verilye and in déede, vnleſſe the ſame be after your reall maner.</p>
            <p>But I muſt put you in mind, that you haue fowly forgotten your ſelfe, when you ſay that the offering that the prieſt maketh
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9612:118"/> in his Maſſe, is a diſtinct offering from that which Chriſt made vpon the croſſe: for you ſhall finde manye of your friendes of a contrarie minde, if ye ſearch their bookes well. But you would ſéeme to make bloudy, and vnbloudy, the difference betwéene thoſe two ſacrifices. Here ſay you (that is in your Maſſe) he is offered of the prieſts, not by ſhedding of his bloud, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, <hi>inſacrificabíliter,</hi> after an vnſacrificable maner, which is not a newe kylling of Chriſt, but a ſolemne repreſentation of his death, as himſelfe hath ordeyned. Here the latter wordes doe confute the firſt. For if the maner of offring in the Maſſe, be ſuch as can not be a ſacrifice: howe can the Maſſe be a ſacrifice? And if the Maſſe be but a ſolemne repreſentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the death of Chriſt: how can it be a ſacrifice offered to almightie God?</p>
            <p>Not the Popiſhe Maſſe, but the bleſſed ſupper of the Lorde, the holy communion of his body and bloud, is a lyuely repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, of his death and paſſion. And as your <hi>Emeſenus</hi> ſayth in the wordes that you cite (for you haue taught him to ſpeake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grue latine nowe) <hi>vere vna &amp; perfecta hoſtia &amp;c.</hi> That ſacrifice which is but one, and is perfite in déede: muſt not be eſtéemed by outwarde ſhewe, nor iudged by the ſight of the outwarde man, but by fayth and the affection of the inwarde man. But eyther not vnderſtanding your <hi>Emeſenus</hi> his wordes, or elſe (after your olde cuſtome) of purpoſe, you corrupt him in the tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For you ſay. This hoſte and ſacrifice, is verily one and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, as though <hi>Emeſenus</hi> had poynted to your Maſſe ſacrifice. Where as it is playne, that he meaneth of that ſacrifice, that is repreſented by the holy communion of the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I may therefore vſe the wordes of your owne exclamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſelfe, and ſuch as be of your minde. For whoſe harts can be imagined to be more hard then youres: which in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt a matter as this, doe not onely, bring in queſtion, the open and manifeſt truth, but alſo in alledging y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of fathers and counſelles, applie them for your purpoſe, contrarye to their meaning? ſeing Chriſt hymſelfe, hys Apoſtles and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes, the auncient fathers and counſels: haue in moſt playne wordes, taught the contrarie of that which you defende. It is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9612:119"/> manifeſt therefore, that you ſtryuing againſt the knowne truth, your owne conſciences &amp; the determination of the whole Church are enimies to God, breakers of his peace. And deuyding your ſelues from the Church, muſt néedes in the ende come to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion euerlaſting, vnleſſe yée repent in tyme.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By this determination of this generall counſell, wee learne that in the myſticall benediction (by which worde is meant this bleſſed Sacrament) wee receaue Chriſtes owne proper fleſhe, and of it we receaue ſanctification and lyfe, before the receypt whereof we celebrate the vnbloudy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the ſame in our Churches, declaring our Lordes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9612:119"/> death, reſurrection, and aſcention, and by this place wee plainely perceiue that the doings and wordes which be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed daylie in our Maſſe, were alſo vſed in the tyme of thys counſell much aboue a thouſande yeares ago.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the wordes of the Epheſian counſell,<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> you would not onely proue the reall preſence in the ſacrament: but alſo that the ſame Apiſhe toyes that be nowe vſed in the Popiſhe Maſſe, were then vſed, which was within <hi>.468.</hi> yeres after Chriſt. But the Popes owne hyſtories doe playnely declare: that the greateſt number of thoſe things, were not as then inuented.</p>
            <p>But to frame the matter ſomewhat better to your purpoſe: you helpe it a little in wryting out the wordes. For in the place of <hi>Sacrificij ſeruitutem:</hi> you write, <hi>Sacrificij cultum.</hi> Suppoſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke that the baſe <hi>Epitheton</hi> of ſeruitude: would abate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, the high eſtimation that you would your Maſſe ſhoulde haue. Well, let that paſſe. It is no fault, in men of your ſort. But let vs ſée howe this place maye proue the reall preſence of Chriſt in the ſacrament.</p>
            <p>The Authors of this Epiſtle, would bring <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> then Byſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> backe agayne from his errour: which was, that of the Virgin Marie, was borne onely the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt, and not Chriſt God and man. So that he deuided Chriſt into two perſons: one diuine, and another humane. And to proue that the manhoode in Chriſt, is ioyned with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in vnitie of perſon: theſe Byſhops doe in this part of their Epiſtle, ioyne to the confeſſion of their beliefe concerning the corporall death, reſurrection, and aſcention of our ſauiour into heauen, the celebration of the remembraunce of his death, which they call <hi>Incruentam ſacrificij ſeruitutem,</hi> the vnbloudy ſeruice of the ſacrifice. And to make their meaning more playne: they ſay that they come to the miſticall benediction, and be made holye, when they be made partakers of the holy body and precious bloud of Chriſt, the redéemer of all. Not receyuing the ſame as common fleſhe, or as the fleſhe of an holy man, or of a man that is ioyned to the ſonne of God by the vnitie of dignitie, or that poſſeſſeth

For (ſay they) he that is lyfe, as beyng God, bycauſe he is vnited to his owne fleſhe, hath declared the ſame to be of force to giue lyfe. &amp;c. Theſe wordes indifferently weighed, doe proue, that the manhood in Chriſt is ioyned to hys diuine nature, in vnitie of perſon: but that the ſame manhood is really preſent in the ſacrament, and therein offered vp in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, can not be proued by theſe wordes.</p>

            <p>So the Fathers of the Epheſian councell, haue verie well confeſſed: that comming to the myſticall benediction, and being made partakers of the holy body and bleſſed bloud of Chriſt, they are ſanctified and made holy, by that quickening fleſhe of Chriſt, which being ioyned to his Godhead in vnitie of perſon, is of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to giue euerlaſting life, to as manye as ſhall be partakers thereof, by dwelling in Chriſt, as ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> hath taught.</p>

               <hi>but becauſe God hath ſo ordeyned.

            <p>
               <hi>And ſo muſt we thinke of all other ſacraments of both the teſtamentes, that they be meanes ordeyned of God to atteine the grace they ſignifie, which grace is fully purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and deſerued by the paſsion of Chriſt, whereof onely
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9612:130"/> they take their effect. For the olde ſacraments haue their vertue and ſtrength. <hi>Ex opere operando</hi> (as the ſchoole men ſay) that is to ſay, of the worke that is to be wrought vpon the Croſſe by Chriſt, in whome onely they beleeued. The new ſacraments haue their vertue <hi>Ex opere operato,</hi> of the worke of Chriſt that is already wrought vpon the croſſe: and not of any worthyneſſe of the prieſt, the miniſter.

            </p>
            <p>It is true,<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> that there be ſome ſacramentes proper to the olde Teſtament, and ſome proper to the newe: but the latter part of that ſentence wherein you affirme this, is ſome thing obſcure.

                  <hi>Gene.</hi> 15. <hi>Luc.</hi> 23. <hi>Acts.</hi> 10.</note> nor col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of grace, without the ſacraments: which ſaying is moſt falſe. For Abraham had his ſinnes forgiuen him, before he was circumciſed: and ſo had the théefe that hanged on the croſſe by Chriſt, without the ſacrament baptiſme. And <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company, had receyued the gift of the holye ghoſt: before they were baptiſed.</p>
            <p>But you ſaye, that ordinarily, there is no remiſſion of ſinnes, nor collation of grace: without ſacramentes.<note place="margin">Watſons dark ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note> By which maner of ſpeaking, you amaze the people: who can gather none other thing thereby, but that commonly God doth not forgiue ſinnes, nor collate or beſtowe his graces vpon any, before they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the ſacraments, that he hath inſtituted to ſignifie the ſame. Which is moſt falſe. For fayth, and the feare of God, are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all heauenly wiſdome: &amp; muſt néedes be had of euery one that ſhall receyue any ſacrament,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.</note> before the receyuing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of can be any thing at all auayleable. For without fayth it is not poſſible to pleaſe God. And he that will not beléeue, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. To receyue a ſacrament therefore without fayth: is to no purpoſe.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:9612:131"/>
            <p>Sacraments, both of the olde and newe Teſtament were inſtituted, not to giue grace, but to confirme the grace alreadie giuen and receyued:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> as appéereth playnely by that which ſaint Paule wryteth to the Romaines. <hi>Et ſignum accepit Circumciſionis, ſignaculum iuſtitiae fidei quae fuerat in praeputio. &amp;c.</hi> And he receyued the ſigne of circumciſion, the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of fayth, which was in him before he was circumciſed: that he might be the father of all that beléeue, among the vncircumciſed, that the ſame might be reconed to them for righteouſneſſe alſo. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By this it is manifeſt, that Gods ordinarie meane of forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſinnes and conferring grace: is by his holy ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby he doth regenerate his elected and choſen children, and not anye Sacramentes, eyther of the olde Teſtament or the newe.</p>
            <p>As for the places that you cite for circumciſion, baptiſme, the ſacrament of Chriſtes body and penaunce: you might haue ſpared till you had founde a fitter place for them. For they ſerue nothing to proue that which you pretend to proue.</p>
            <p>We knowe, that baptiſme is the ſame to vs, that circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was to the fathers, and that as the vncircumciſed might not be ſuffred to liue among the people of God: ſo ſuch as refuſe bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, cannot ſée the kingdome of God. And that except we doe eate the fleſhe of the ſonne of man and drinke his bloud: we ſhall haue no lyfe in vs. And that except we repent: we ſhal all periſh as the Galileans did. But what maketh this for the proofe of your purpoſe?

            <p>A perfect and contynuall lawe, requireth a perfect and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ſacrifice, as you ſay: and ſhall not that reaſonable ſeruing of God that ſaint Paule ſpeaketh of in the place that you haue taken for your theme, be as perfect and contynuing a ſacrifice,<note place="margin">

            <p>For this cauſe (ſay you) our ſauiour Chriſt, did in his laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtitute. &amp;c. you tell vs here, of two ſeuerall vſes of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſts body and bloud. One is, that it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued of vs. &amp;c. This you confirme with a note in the mergine. <hi>1. Cor. 11.</hi> It is true that Paule teacheth that doctrine there,<note place="margin">Paules doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine not ſo groſſe as Watſons.</note> euen as he himſelfe had learned of the Lorde: but not in ſuch groſſe maner as you doe teach in theſe two fine Sermons. He teacheth there, that our ſauiour chriſt did ordain, that this holy ſacrament ſhould be receiued of chriſtians: in the remembrance of his death &amp; paſſion, &amp; that being ſo receiued of vs, it is a foode y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doth nouriſh vs in ſpiritual life.

            <p>As for the other vſe, which you ſay is, to be offered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of Chriſtes paſſion: you go about to proue, by doe this in my remembrance. And then (very well) you ſay, that you haue but ſimply declared it without euident proofe.

Might not your new men thinke you, iuſtly laugh at you: when you alledge that for your purpoſe, that maketh moſt againſt you? doe this ſayth Chriſt. What ſhall we doe? ſay you. Take bread ſaith Chriſt. And when you haue giuen thanks: breake it and diſtribute it, and eate it, for it is my bodye. Then take the cup, and when ye haue giuen thankes: drinke ye all of it, for it is my bloud of the new teſtament, which is ſhed for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye for the remiſſion of ſinnes. Thus farre according as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe wryteth.</p>
            <p>What ground haue you in theſe wordes, for the inſtitution of the Maſſe? He doth not ſay, prepare you miniſtring garments of a ſtraunge faſhion. Neyther doth he bid you make thoſe gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments holye. He ſpeaketh no word of your halowed aultare, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraltare, Cup, or Corporaſſe cloth. He maketh no mention of your thinne ſtertch cake, nor of myxing water with your wine. He hath no worde of your manifolde croſſings, turnings, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9612:135"/> halfe turnings, with the reſt of the Apiſhe toyes whereof your Maſſe doth conſiſt. But he tooke bread and wine,<note place="margin">What Chriſt did at his laſt ſupper.</note> ſuch as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion did offer. And he gaue thankes to his heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and did preſently diſtribute the ſame to thoſe Diſciples of his that were then preſent, commaunding them all to eate and drinke thereof in the remembraunce of his death and paſſion, as often as they ſhould thinke it méete by a ſacrament to celebrate the remembrance thereof. Aſſuring them that in ſo doing, they ſhould be partakers of his body and bloud, to the nouriſhing of their ſoules and bodies to euerlaſting lyfe.</p>
            <p>Here is a playne inſtitution of the holye communion of the body and bloud of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt: but for your tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiating conſecration that you vſe in your Maſſe, here is no warrant at all. By your owne iudgement therefore, your Antichriſtian Clarkes are but vſurpers, hauing no warrant in the worde of God, to ſhewe for your doings in this point. The matter therfore is not ſo playne on your ſide: as you would haue men thinke it to be.</p>
            <p>The lyke foundation you haue founde to builde your oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon. Chriſt hath ſayd: Which is giuen for you. And to your ſimple iudgement: there ſéemeth no little argument, in this word <hi>Datur,</hi> is giuen. &amp;c. And therfore you conclude: that Chriſt did at his laſt ſupper, euen in the ſupper time, offer his body for vs to his father.</p>
            <p>Mathew, and Marke, make no mention of this <hi>Datur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.</note> that you builde vpon. Bilyke therefore, it is not ſo great a matter as you would make of it. For if the church can haue no ſacrifice but that which is builded vpon <hi>Datur,</hi> it is to be thought that Mathew and Marke knewe nothing of the Church ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>But in Luke you finde <hi>Quod pro vobis datur,</hi> which is giuen for you, not to you, as <hi>Zwynglius</hi> and <hi>Cranmer</hi> his Scholer, would haue it. You conclude therefore, that giuen for vs, muſt néedes ſignifie, offred for vs. So that in this place and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (but you name not one) to giue, is to offer.<note place="margin">Many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces but none named.</note> And becauſe all the Euangeliſtes haue it in the Gréeke expreſſed in the preſent tenſe. &amp;c. you thinke you may certainely conclude, becauſe Chriſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9612:136"/> ſayth <hi>Datur pro vobis,</hi> is giuen for you: that euen then in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time, he offered his body for vs to his father.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I muſt ſay vnto you, that when you ſhall ſhewe vs, thoſe places, wherein, to giue is to offer: then we will weigh them, and if we ſhall finde that true which you affirme here, we will ſay as you ſay, that Chriſt did in his laſt ſupper offer vp his body to his father.

            <p>And although this be expreſſed in the preſent tenſe, and euery ſentence is true for the time it is pronounced:<note place="margin">The ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is the truth of the ſentence ſpoken.</note> yet may you not conclude as you doe certainly and ſay, that Chriſt offred his body in his ſupper. For the truth of the ſentence, is in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that doth by other partes of ſcripture, appéere to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſpeaker.</p>
            <p>Chriſtes body was giuen for vs, when he became man that he might dye for vs, when he was giuen ouer into the power of his enimies which ſought his lyfe, when he went vp to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, declaring before hande to his Diſciples, that he muſt there be crucified: and when Iudas had bargayned with the highe prieſts, to deliuer him to them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">When Chriſt was giuen and his body broken for vs.</note>And when our Sauiour chriſt was cruelly dealt with by the Iewes in any condition: then was his body broken for vs. Thus are theſe ſentences true for the time they were pronounced: and yet, neyther doth giuen ſignifie offred, nor broken ſignifie, torne in péeces.</p>
            <p>Thirdly (you ſay) chriſt did deliuer to his Diſciples to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and dronken:<note place="margin">Watſon hath ouerſhot himſelfe to farre.</note> that which he had before conſecrated and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

If he did conſecrate with theſe wordes, this is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9612:136"/> my body: this is my bloud: then could he offer to his father none other thing but bread and wine, before he had giuen the ſame to his Diſciples.

If conſent of the Euangeliſtes, both in the Gréeke and Latine doe giue vauntage as in <hi>Datur,</hi> giuen, you would faine it ſhould: then muſt it of force giue vauntage here, for none of them doth place the words otherwiſe. And you your ſelfe haue affirmed before: that with thoſe wordes Chriſt did conſecrate.</p>
            <p>Yea, though you woulde denie it, and affirme that Chriſt did conſecrate by his almightie power, vſing ſome other wordes of bleſſing. Yet your ſchoole men will not ſuffer you.<note place="margin">

This muſt needes be the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſſe, or elſe let them that ſay nay, ſhew of what other that place is ment. And in very deede ſome haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed all their wit and learning, writhing and racking this place to make it ſerue to ſome other ſacrifice beſide the Maſſe, but it will not bee, the truth hath euer preuayled.

            <p>Saint Paule, writing to the Hebrues:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.</note> goeth about to diſwade them from the vayne confidence they had in the ſacrifices and ceremonies of Moſes lawe, and to perſwade them to put their truſt in that one only ſacrifice that Chriſt had made, offring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe once for all. And leaſt they ſhould reiect his doctrine as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no ground in the holy ſcriptures: he putteth them in minde of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> who was a figure of Chriſt. And of his prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: which was alſo a figure of Chriſtes prieſthood. Firſt, he was a figure of Chriſt (ſayth ſaint Paule) in that he was called <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> which is by interpretation,<note place="margin">The minde of Paule in making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech.</note> the king of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and the king of <hi>Salem,</hi> which is, the king of peace.

And therefore (ſayth ſaint Paule) he is lykened to the ſonne of God that is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and hath an euerlaſting prieſthood, and is alwayes able to ſaue them that ſeeke ſaluation at his hande, bicauſe he lyueth euer to make interceſſion for vs.</p>
            <p>This is the minde of ſaint Paule, as may eaſily appéere, to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9612:147"/> as many as will with indifferent mindes read that which he hath written in the ſeuenth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the Hebrues. But contrary to this meaning, doe you moſt wylfully gather: that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was a figure of Chriſt and of his prieſthood, in that he vſed to offer to God, a ſacrifice of bread and wine. This you ſuck out of your owne fingers, and out of the dugs of ſuch dreaming Doctors as you your ſelfe are: although you would ſéeme to haue learned al that you ſpeake, in the ſchoole of <hi>Cyprian Auſten, Hierome,</hi> and ſuch other auncient and learned fathers.</p>

                  <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 9.</note> in this wyſe. <hi>Qui eſt inſipiens declinet ad me &amp; indigentibus ſenſu dixit. Venite &amp; edite de meis panibus, &amp; bibete vinum quod miſcui vobis. Vinum mixtum declarat, id eſt Calicem Domini aqua &amp; vino mixtum, prophetica voce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciat, vt appareat in paſsione dominica id eſſe geſtum, quod fuerat prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictum.</hi> Wiſedome (ſayth Salomon) ſent forth hir ſeruauntes, ſaying. Let him that is fooliſhe, turne in vnto me. And to ſuch as lack vnderſtanding ſhe ſayde. Come and eate of my bread, and drinke the wine that I haue mixed for you. Shée declareth (ſayth <hi>Cyprian</hi>) that the wine is mixed. That is to ſay, ſhée doth with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9612:147"/> the voyce of prophecie declare, that the Lordes cup is mixed with water and wine: that it might appéere that in the Lordes paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thing was done in déede, which had bene told of before.</p>
            <p>By theſe words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> it appéereth plainely: that the cauſe why he woulde haue water mixed with the wine in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Lordes ſupper, was to ſhewe that the prophecie which Salomon vttered in the perſon of wiſedome, was fulfilled in the paſſion of Chriſt, when water and bloud did iſſue out of his ſide. And alſo to imitate the example of Chriſt: who (as <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> ſuppoſeth) did not drinke wine without the mixture of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His whole purpoſe therfore in this Epiſtle,<note place="margin">Cyprians purpoſe in his Epiſtle to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> being to diſproue the doing of thoſe which vſed to miniſter with water without wine: he ſought for many figures in the olde Teſtament, which might ſéeme to be prophecies of Chriſtes miniſtration in his laſt ſupper. And he applyeth them to proue: that water alone could not ſerue to ſignifie that which Chriſt would haue to be ſignified by it. And (as in ſuch caſe it may eaſily happen) when he findeth a figure, wherein mention is made of ſuch mixture: he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that Chriſt mixed water with the wine, and he conceyueth in his minde, that the wine muſt ſignifie Chriſt, and the water, the people. And ſo he maketh as great a matter of the omitting of the water, as he did before, of the leauing out of the wine. Not remembring, that he had at the firſt applied to his purpoſe, <hi>Noes</hi> drinking of wine, and <hi>Mechiſedechs</hi> bringing forth of bread and wine: where there is no mention at all, of water mixed wyth the wine.</p>
            <p>But as I haue written in mine aunſwere to the <hi>.24.</hi> diuiſion of your former Sermon: let vs not forget the wordes of <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> in the Epiſtle that he wrote before the workes of <hi>Hilarius:</hi>

               <note place="margin">Wherein Chriſt is like Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech.</note> without father, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and without generation. And he doth there moſt diligently enterprete: wherefore he is without father, without mother, and without generation. And all eccleſiaſticall perſons doe ſay. That Chriſt is ſayde to be without father in that he is man, and without mother, in that he is God. Let vs therefore interprete this onely: thou art a prieſt for euer after the order of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech.</hi> Let vs onely declare this thing. Wherfore he hath ſaid: after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order. According to the order, is as much as to ſay. Thou ſhalt not be a prieſt according to the Iewiſh ſacrifices: but thou ſhalt be a prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> And then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe words that you haue cyted. <hi>Quomodo enim. &amp;c.</hi> And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after thoſe wordes he ſayth. <hi>Iste Melchiſedech, ista myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria quae habemus dedit nobis. &amp;c.</hi> This <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> hath giuen vs theſe myſteries that we haue.

            <p>You muſt néedes graunt, that our myſterie, is our coupling togither into members of one body in Chriſt, wherof ſaint Paule ſpeaketh to the Epheſians. When he ſayth. <hi>Myſterium hoc mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt,</hi>

            <p>This myſterie was not ſignified by Aarons ſacrifices (ſayth
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9612:150"/> ſaint <hi>Hierome</hi>): but by the bread and wine, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> brought forth to refreſhe Abraham and his Souldiours withall.<note place="margin">

            <p>Your application of this place of <hi>Hierome,</hi> might well haue bene ſpared therfore: if you had dealt plainly with your auditory. For it is now manifeſt to the reader: that ſaint <hi>Hierome</hi> ment nothing leſſe, then to teache that Chriſt offered himſelfe once at two times, and after two orders:<note place="margin">The order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech declared</note> but he buyldeth vpon ſaint Paules wordes, who ſayth that Chriſt was not a prieſt to offer after Aarons order, but after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and euerlaſting ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Now muſt <hi>Auſten</hi> help you to patch out this matter.<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſal. <hi>33.</hi> &amp; De Ciuit. Dei li. <hi>17.</hi> cap. <hi>20.</hi>

               </hi> he ſayth thus. <hi>Quid credibilius dicere. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> ſhould in theſe two places teach, as in your application, you doe beare your Auditorie in hande that he doth teache:<note place="margin">Watſon would haue Auſten teach falſe doctrine.</note> then were his doctrine moſt falſe and contrarie to the Euangelicall hyſtorie. For where as the Goſpell ſayth, that Chriſt did inſtitute the ſacrament of his body and bloud, the night before he ſuffered: ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi> muſt ſay (if you apply his words aright) that he did firſt ſuffer, and then inſtitute the ſacrament of his body and bloud afterward.</p>
            <p>But I will not for your pleaſure conceyue ſuch an opinion of <hi>Auſten:</hi> for I know he was farre from that ſhamefull errour and open falſhood. He taught truely, that in the time of the olde lawe among the people of the Iewes: Chriſt was a ſacrifice af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Aaron, for by euery bloudy ſacrifice, was the death of Chriſt plainely ſet forth, to as many as had eyes to looke, and ſe thorow the ſhadow of the law. But after al thoſe ſacrifices that were offered, in the ſhadow of a thing to come: he prepared a ſacrifice after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> that is euerlaſting, and that of his owne body and bloud, which is the foode that fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth into euerlaſting lyfe.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:9612:151"/>
            <p>And that this is ſaint <hi>Auſtens</hi> meaning: is playne by that which in the booke that you cite, <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi> he addeth to the wordes that you cite. His words be theſe. <hi>Propter quod etiam vocem illam in pſalmo triceſimo &amp; nono, eiuſdem mediatoris per Prophetam lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentis, agnoſcimus ſacrificium &amp; oblationem noluiſti, corpus autem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feciſti mihi, quia pro illis omnibus ſacrificijs &amp; oblationibus, corpus eius of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertur, &amp; participantibus miniſtratur.</hi> Wherfore (ſayth ſaint <hi>Auſten</hi>) We doe acknowledge that voyce of the ſame Meditatour, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Prophet in the Pſalme <hi>.39.</hi> in this wyſe: thou haſt not deſired ſacrifice and oblation, but thou haſt made me a perfite bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, for his body is offered in ſtede of all thoſe ſacrifices and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and is miniſtred to ſuch as be partakers thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual offering of Chriſt.</note>This ſacrifice, bicauſe it is eternall after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,</hi> is ſtill preſently offered by the Meaditor Chriſt: who is both the prieſt and ſacrifice, and continually miniſtred, to them that be partakers thereof by faith, by that ſpiritual maner of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, whereby ſpirituall lyfe, is miniſtred from the head Chriſt to his members the Church.</p>
            <p>But nowe, to ende this matter: your Auditorie muſt heare one place more, which is playneſt of all. <hi>Oecumenius</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>Significat ſermo. &amp;c.</hi> If I might vſe ſuch libertie in cyting places, as you doe in this: I could eaſily finde plaine places ynough to proue whatſoeuer I luſted to take in hande. Where the author hath ſayde <hi>Significat ſermo, quod licet Chriſtus non obtulerit carentem ſanguine hoſtiam (ſiquidem ſuum ipſius corpus obtulit) attamen qui ab ipſo fungentur ſacerdotio. &amp;c.</hi> The ſignification of this ſaying is: that although Chriſt did not offer a ſacrifice without bloud (for he offered his owne body) yet ſhall thoſe that ſhall after him execute the office of prieſthood (whoſe high prieſt God doth vouchſafe to be) offer without bloud. For that is ſignified by this ſaying. For euer. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe be the wordes of <hi>Oecumenius:</hi> as <hi>Hentenius</hi> hath tranſlated them out of the Gréeke. But you had promiſed your Auditorie a playner place then this was beyng thus tranſlated. For this is playne againſt all that you haue done before, in proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that our Sauiour Chriſt did offer himſelfe without bloud.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9612:151"/> For this felow being thus tranſlated, ſayth: Although Chriſt did not offer a ſacrifice without bloud. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Well therefore, to make the place plaine in déede, you haue amended the tranſlation, I trowe, and you haue ſayde: <hi>Significat ſermo, quod non ſolum Chriſtus obtulit incruentam hoſtiam (ſiquidem ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ipſius corpus obtulit) verum etiam qui ab ipſo. &amp;c.</hi> The word mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that not onely Chriſt offered an vnbloudy ſacrifice (for he offered his owne body) but alſo they that ſhall vnder him vſe the function of a prieſt (whoſe Byſhop he doth vouchſafe to be) ſhall offer without ſhedding of bloud. Well, eyther you,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Oecumenius</hi> belyed in tranſlating.</note> or your friend <hi>Hentenius</hi> haue belyed the Gréeke. For here is playne contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The one ſayth.

And peraduenture if the Gréeke might be ſéene and well viewed: you might be founde falſe harlots both (for <hi>Hentenius</hi> was a Louaniſt. &amp;c.) For who ſo readeth the reſt that <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> hath collected out of other wryters that were before his time, and patched togither into one commentarie vpon the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Hebrues: he ſhall haue but little occaſion to thinke that <hi>Oecumenius</hi> could be of ſuch minde concerning the meaning of theſe wordes, <hi>Tu es ſacerdos in aeternum,</hi> thou art a prieſt for euer: as in this place that you cite, he ſheweth himſelfe to be, when he ſayth, Chriſt could not be ſayde to be a prieſt for euer, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe ſacrifycing prieſtes that are now, by whoſe meanes he doth ſtill offer and is offred.

            <p>So farre off are theſe auncient fathers, from maintayning your carnall opinion, of the corporall eating of Chriſtes bodie in the ſacrament thereof. But if time would haue ſerued you, you could haue made an argument of Daniels prophecie. &amp;c. Well, as time would ſuffer, you bungle vp a reaſon: and thus you ſay. Antichriſt can not take away the ſacrifice that Chriſt offered on the Croſſe, nor the inward ſacrifice of mans heart: wherefore it is the Maſſe that is the continuall ſacrifice,<note place="margin">Watſon hath time ynough to proue his arguments.</note> and muſt be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Antichriſt. I denie your argument. Graunting you as much time for the proufe thereof, with the other two that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: as you your ſelfe will take.</p>
            <p>And becauſe you would haue vs tell you, what other ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice beſides the Maſſe, it is that Antichriſt may take away: I wil tell you what ſacrifice it is in my iudgement, and then let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader be iudge betwixt my iudgement and yours.</p>
            <p>In my iudgement, the contynuall ſacrifice that Antichriſt may take away from the Church of Chriſt: is that which ſaint
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:9612:155"/> Paule ſpeaketh of when he ſayth.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. What ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt may take away.</note> 
               <hi>Per ipſum igitur offerrimus ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium laudis ſemper Deo: hoc eſt fructum labiorum confitentium nomen eius.</hi> Through him therefore, we doe alwayes offer vnto God, a ſacrifice of praiſe: that is, the fruit of thoſe lips, that doe confeſſe his name. This ſacrifice, hath Antichriſt of Rome taken away from the vniuerſall Church of Chriſt in taking vpon himſelfe the title of vniuerſall head of the ſame Church, which tytle is due to Chriſt onely, and in taking vpon him the authoritie and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, to remitte and pardon ſinnes, which power belongeth to God onely. The fruite of thoſe lips that confeſſe his name is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: when none may without perill of death, confeſſe that Chriſt onely is the vniuerſall head of his Church: and that God onely, in his ſonne Chriſt and for his ſake, doth fréely forgiue and pardon ſinnes. Thus you haue my iudgement of a ſacrifice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynuall, that may be taken away by Antichriſt: and yet is not your Popiſhe Maſſe.</p>
            <p>The thrée yeres and halfe alſo, may well be applyed to the times, wherin the power of Rome hath taken away this ſacrifice by cruell perſecution: ſo that very few or none in all the knowne worlde, durſt offer this ſacrifice to God. Now let the indifferent reader be iudge betwéene your iudgement &amp; mine, in this matter of a continuall ſacrifice, that may be taken away by Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>But that Daniell ment there to prophecy, that Antichriſt ſhal take away the continuall ſacrifice: the text will not ſuffer me to thinke. For he ſayth thus. <hi>A tempore oblationis iugis ſacrificij,</hi>

Which is the time, two times, and halfe a time that he ſpake of before.</p>
            <p>The continuall ſacrifice of the temple, was fully ended and taken away by Chriſtes one oblation of hymſelfe:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2.</note> and the abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of deſolation, is ſet vp in the Church of Chriſt, the man of ſinne boaſting himſelfe to be God, as doth the Antichriſt of Rome, which ſetteth vp himſelfe aboue all that is called God, that is aboue all Princes and earthly Potentates. The ſpace
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9612:156"/> therefore betwéene the ending of the ceremoniall ſacrifices, and Chriſtes comming to iudgement: may be a time, two times, and halfe a time. That is, a long time, twiſe ſo long a time, to the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent deſire that Gods elect haue to ſée the ende: and but halfe a tyme, that is to ſay, a verie ſhort time in compariſon of that euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting time, wherein they ſhall raigne with Chriſt in glorie incomparable.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The hoſte of theſe two ſacrifices vpon the croſſe and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aultar, is all one in ſubſtaunce, but the maner is dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and the ende is dyuers, that by this meanes (as Chriſt himſelfe hath inſtituted) we might celebrate &amp; make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of his paſsion. This is onely the ſacrifice of the prieſt by publicke miniſtration, but verily and in affection it is the ſacrifice of the whole Church, which euerye mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church doth vſe and frequent, no man doth impugne it, but he that profeſſeth open warre againſt the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly Chriſt is offered by man ſpiritually onely by the meditation of our minde, when we thinke and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his paſsion, and in our deuout prayer beſeech God to ſhowe vs mercy for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus euery chriſten man and woman, in all places and times vppon the aultar his owne heart, ought to offer Chriſt to the father, after which ſort of ſpirituall oblation we be all both men and women, prieſtes and kings, being as ſaint Peter ſayth. <hi>Sacerdotium ſanctum,</hi>

               <hi>Now conſidering theſe three wayes, ſhall it be a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to inculcate one way and to reiect the reſt? To alledge one member of a deuiſion, to the reiection of the

This is the peculiar maner of the heretikes the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt, as they did in the matter of the ſacrament, by the ſpirituall eating of Chriſt to confute and reiect the reall and corporall eating of Chriſts body in the ſacrament.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Such ſhiftes and fonde arguments they haue to ſeduce the vnlearned withall, which when they bee eſpyed and detected they appeare as they be Deuilliſhe and pernycious Sophiſtrie.</hi>

            <p>Theſe be the ſcriptures (ſay you) that they alledge agaynſt the Maſſe: as though thoſe ſcriptures were of no weight in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thoſe that you haue to alledge for the Maſſe. Or elſe that they were wreſted ſo farre out of ſquare: that all the world might ſée, that they make nothing for the purpoſe. But that the reader may ſée, that theſe ſcriptures, ſo alledged as they be by vs againſt the Maſſe, be of ſome force to proue that which we would proue by them: I will vpon theſe ſcriptures and your anſwere, forme this reaſon or argument.<note place="margin">An argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for watſon to aunſwere.</note> Whatſoeuer action is but once done, is not done often or euery day.

            <p>You would make your hearers beleue, that we go about to confute one truth by another. But I truſt to cauſe the reader to ſée: that you confirme one lye by another. We graunt that it is true, that Chriſt was offered but once for ſinne: and that that once muſt néedes be by ſhedding of his bloud.<note place="margin">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9612:158"/> Chriſt that ſhould purchaſe forgiueneſſe of ſinnes: muſt néedes haue his bloud ſhed, according to the figures of the olde lawe, which did all preach the ſhedding of the bloud of him that ſhould purge vs, and make vs cleane from ſinne.</p>
            <p>We do not by the affirming of this truth: denie any other truth. But if there be any that will ſay, that Chriſt is offered for ſinne any oftner then once, or any otherwyſe then by death and the ſhedding of his bloud: then doe we alledge this truth (grounded vpon the ſcriptures, and confeſſed by you) agaynſt that falſehoode affirmed by ſuch as ſay that Chriſt is offered for ſinne oftner then once, or any otherwiſe then by death, and the ſhedding of his bloud.</p>
            <p>If you can finde any imperfection in Chriſtes one oblation once offered: then blame vs, for that we ſay it is perfite.<note place="margin">None can offer Chriſt but himſelfe</note> And if you can finde any man or other creature, that is able to offer Chriſt for ſinne: then blame vs, for that we ſay, that none can offer him for ſinne but himſelfe.</p>

            <p>What ſhameleſſe beaſt would ſaye, that Daniell ſawe the Angels offer Chriſt in ſacrifice to his father:<note place="margin">watſon was deepe in his oblations.</note> becauſe the text ſayth. <hi>Et in conſpectu eius obtulerunt eum.</hi> And they preſented hym before him.

            <p>And the virgine Mary bicauſe ſhe preſented hir ſonne Ieſus in the temple, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of Moſes: ſhe muſt néedes be ſayd to offer him in ſacrifice.<note place="margin">

The virgine Marie therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the temple to do for hir firſt borne ſonne according to the law: did offer that offering that the law did require. The Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt ſaint Luke, who wryteth the Hyſtorye, ſayth that they brought Ieſus to Ieruſalem, <hi>vt ſisterent eum Domino,</hi> to ſet him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, or to make him appeare before the Lorde.</p>

            <p>And therfore we aunſwere you, that our arguments are to ſtrong for you to confute, by telling vs that Chriſt is offered thrée wayes of himſelfe, and thrée wayes of man. For we know that he was neuer offered for ſinne, mo wayes then one. But let vs ſee how you proue theſe ſix maners of offering Chriſt.

            <p>Secondly, Chriſt offered himſelfe in figure, when he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Paſcall Lambe. And this you proue by the .xiij. of ſaint Iohns Reuelations.<note place="margin">

And the memorie of this promiſe hath bene kept, by the Paſcall Lambe and other ſacrifices: and the maner of the fulfilling of it, plainly paynted out, to ſuch as could conſider them with a ſpirituall eye. But the offering of the Paſcall Lambe and other ſacrifices, was not inſtituted, that the offerers might thereby offer vp Chriſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely: but to kéepe in memory, the promiſe, and to ſet forth before their ſenſes, the maner of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fulfilling of the promiſe, when the time of fulfilling the ſame ſhould come.</p>
            <p>The Paſcall alſo, had one ſpeciall vſe: which was to kéepe in minde, the wonderfull deliueraunce that God wrought in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, as it appeareth in <hi>Exodi.</hi> Where it is written thus. <hi>Cum dixerint filij veſtri: quae eſt iſta Religio? Dicetis eis.</hi>

            <p>Here is no worde of the offering of Chriſt figuratiuely in the olde Paſchall: but when Chriſt paſſed from death to life, then he was offered, ſayth ſaint <hi>Auſten.</hi> Wherfore I conclude. That Chriſt did not offer himſelfe figuratiuely in the olde Paſchall, neyther did the fathers of the olde lawe, offer him in their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.

            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt offereth himſelfe in heauen, really, and ſo continually: as the ſame Chapiter that we bring againſt the Maſſe doth teſtifie (ſay you) <hi>Non in manufacta. &amp;c.</hi> Ieſus entred not into a temple made with handes. &amp;c.

            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:9612:161"/>
            <p>By occaſion of the wordes of the Prophet Dauid, where he ſayth.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Notum fac mihi Domine. &amp;c.</hi> Lorde, let me know mine ende, and what the number of my dayes is, that I may know what it is that I lack: ſaint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth note, that the ende which the Prophet doth deſire to know, is that day wherein euery one ſhall riſe out of the earth in his order, wherein our perfection doth begin. Here therefore (ſayth <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) that is in this mortall ſtate: there is a let or impediment, there is infirmitie, euen in ſuch as be perfite, but there (that is in the lyfe to come) there is full perfection. Therefore, he deſireth to knowe, what dayes of eternall lyfe, are yet remayning, not what dayes be paſt. That he may know what he himſelfe lacketh, what the lande of promiſe is, which bringeth forth contynuall fruites, what maner dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, the firſt, ſecond, and thirde dwelling are wyth the father, wherein euery man doth reſt according to his worthyneſſe.

            <p>Who would thinke that any man of learning, coulde be ſo blynded, as to vnderſtand theſe wordes of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> as you doe? His whole purpoſe is to declare, that in this mortall ſtate: there can be no perfection in any thing. But the moſt perfite things that be here: are but as ymages are in compariſon of thoſe things whereof they be ymages. Yea, the mediation of Chriſt betwixt God and man: was not without imperfection, in the ymage and outwarde ſhewe thereof. For he ſuffered (ſayth <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) as a man, and as one worthyly condemned to die. And he offered himſelfe as a prieſt doth offer ſacrifice: to releaſe vs of our ſinnes.

            <p>And to put all men out of doubt, that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> meaneth not to maintaine your madde aſſertion, of a perpetual oblation made by Chriſt in ſuch ſort as you imagine.

Here it is manifeſt, that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſuppoſed that the ſinnes of all the faithfull, were cleane conſumed, by that one oblation that Chriſt offered once for all.</p>
            <p>So that it is playne without all controuerſie: that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> minded not to teache that Chriſt doth continually offer himſelfe a ſacrifice to his father for vs: but that the mortall ſtate in thys worlde, is in compariſon of the immortall ſtate in heauen, but euen as an ymage is, in compariſon of the thing that it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. As for the place that you cite out of ſaint Iohns Epiſtle: is aunſwered by that which you your ſelfe haue ſayde of the firſt way of Chriſts offering of himſelfe. For you ſay that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was done
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:9612:162"/> really, and corporally: and that our exclamations of once, once, haue very good place there. I am ſure you do not thinke, that this moſt perfite maner of offring that you ſpeak of here (wherof you ſay the firſt was but an ymage) ſhould be other then real &amp; corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.

I thinke the Diuines of your owne ſort:<note place="margin">was and ſhall haue no place in God.</note> doe lament to ſée you take holde of ſo ſlender a ſtay as this, to kéepe you from falling. For what Diuine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not: that was, and ſhall, haue no place in Gods doings, when men will ſpeake properly of him and his doings? God in himſelfe is alwayes that, which with vs, and in our maner of ſpéeche, he is ſayde to haue bene, or ſhall be. It would haue done well, if you could haue cyted but one wryter, eyther auncient or newe: that vnderſtandeth this place as you doe.

But theſe wordes are ſpoken after the maner of men, and by a certaine diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: euen as is this. The ſonne can doe nothing of himſelf: Theſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:9612:162"/> wordes he ſpeaketh: leaſt he ſhould ſéeme to be againſt God. For he had already ſhewed in the man that was ſick of a palſey: that the ſonne alſo, had power to forgiue ſinnes. Alſo in gyuing hys Diſciples power to forgiue ſinnes: he ſhewed that he did by his owne power graunt that. But as I haue ſayde, the Apoſtle doth ſpeake this nowe, eyther by diſpenſation: or elſe to ſhewe that the nature and power of the ſonne, is all one and the ſame with the father. And that whatſoeuer thing one of the thrée holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould doe: the ſame ſhould be common to the reſt.</p>
            <p>By this we may ſee: that you haue wreſted the plaine ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to proue the thrée folde offering of Chriſt, beſide the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf in his ſupper, which is the point that you go about to declare. We deny not that Chriſt is our aduocate, and ſacrifice propitiatorie for our ſinnes: but we confeſſe, that he is, hath bene, and ſhall be ſo for euer,<note place="margin">The act of mediation once done.</note> extending the vertue &amp; force of his death and bloudſhedding, to all the faythfull that eyther haue béene, or ſhall be, betwéene the firſt man and the laſt. But the action of oblation, is but one and once done vpon the croſſe, when he ſayd <hi>Conſummatum eſt.</hi> It is finiſhed.</p>
            <p>As for the thrée wayes that you ſay Chriſt is offered by man: are not worth the weighing. Figuratiuely (you ſaye) Chriſt is offered in the oblation of the olde Teſtament. Here, was, would haue ſerued better then, is. And yet he was not then offered: as I haue ſhewed in that which I haue aunſwered to the ſeconde way of Chriſtes offering himſelfe.</p>
            <p>In your Maſſe, you ſay, you offer him myſtically. I might conclude, that therefore you do not offer him, really and corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and ſo ſet you againſt your ſelfe. For you haue ſayd oftenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in theſe your two ſermons: that you receiue and offer chriſt in your Maſſe, really, corporally, and naturally. But you wil vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by myſtically, as you doe by ſacramentally: and ſaye that myſtically, is verily, and really. For you haue learned of <hi>Gracians</hi> gloſe to ſay: <hi>Statuimus: id eſt. Abrogamus.</hi> We decrée,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> Myſticall can not be reall. &amp;c.</note> that is, we do abrogate: you may giue to wordes what ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you luſt. But ſuch as be learned in the tongues, doe knowe that myſticall, can not ſignifie, reall, naturall and corporall.</p>
            <p>A number of things (you ſay) are done in your Maſſe. That
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9612:163"/> is to ſay, Chriſt is by his omnipotent power preſented to you: and of you, to his and your father. His paſſion is renewed: and the remiſſion that was purchaſed and deſerued thereby, humbly prayed for to God, that the ſame may be applyed vnto you by Chriſt. &amp;c. Becauſe all this is but your bare aſſertion without proofe, either by authoritie or reaſon: It ſhall ſuffice that I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere as ſaint <hi>Hierome</hi> doth in like caſe.<note place="margin">Hiero. in Mat. <hi>23.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Hoc quia de ſcripturis. &amp;c</hi> Becauſe this thing hath none authoritie of the ſcripture: it is as eaſily contemned as allowed.</p>
            <p>But here I muſt tell you, that in one point, you diſcent from many of your ſort: which ſay that the maſſing prieſt doth by his maſſe apply the paſſion of Chriſt to them that he ſayth Maſſe for. And you do but ioyne it with your fayth and deuotion in making humble prayer to God, that it would pleaſe him to applye to you the remiſſion that Chriſt hath deſerued by his paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Peter.</hi> 2.</note>To proue the third way that men offer Chriſt, which is (ſay you) by the meditation of the minde. &amp;c. You alledge the ſaying of Peter. <hi>Sacerdotium Sanctum. &amp;c.</hi> How well theſe wordes of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do ſerue to proue your offering of Chriſt onely by meditation of minde: ſhal eaſily appeare to ſuch as will reade the reſt of that Chapter.<note place="margin">Spirituall ſacrifices.</note> They ſhall finde that the ſpirituall ſacrifices that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeaketh of there: are a godly and honeſt lyfe, full of good workes, and not ſuch idle meditations as you ymagine.</p>
            <p>Now, ſéeing that you haue deuided the offering vp of Chriſt into ſo many members, and haue proued but one: ſhall it not be a good argument to inculcate one &amp; reiect the reſt? This is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar maner of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſts, the profeſſed enimies of Chriſt, euen as they doe in teaching the reall and corporall eating of Chriſtes bodie in the ſacrament: ſo in this matter of the ſacrificeing and offering of Chriſt, to imagine a multitude of members, where in déede there is but one.

The fleſh and bloud of this ſacrifice, was before the comming of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens minde in plaine wordes.</note> promiſed by ſacrifices of ſimilitudes. In the paſſion of Chriſt: it was performed by the truth thereof in déede. And after the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt it is celebrated by a ſacrament of remembraunce. And agayne he ſayth. <hi>Non ergo illi Patres noſtri, &amp;c.</hi> Thoſe our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers therefore, did not onely leaue the ymages of the heathen, but they neyther offring any thing to the earth, nor to any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye thing, neyther to the ſea, neyther to the heauen: did offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to one God, the creator of all thinges, euen ſuch as he would ſhould be offered vnto him. Promiſing by the ſimilitude of thoſe ſacrifices: that ſacrifice, by which through the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, he hath reconciled vs to himſelfe, in Chriſt Ieſu oure Lorde. To the faithfull that are made the body of that head, doth Paule ſpeake ſaying, I beſéech you brethren, euen for the mercie
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9612:167"/> of God, make your bodies, a liuing, holy, and acceptable ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Theſe words well weighed togither with thoſe that you haue alledged: will make Saint <hi>Auſtens</hi> minde be knowne to differ farre from yours. It is not your maſking mumming Maſſe, that he calleth the ſacrament of remembraunce,<note place="margin">Not the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Maſſe, but the holy communion.</note> whereby the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of praiſe is celebrated among the chriſtians: but it is the holy communion of Chriſtes body and bloud. This he calleth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde worke of fayth, to this he ioyneth the conſecrating and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating of the hole man to the ſeruice of God: which he calleth (as ſaint Paule doth) the lyuing, holy, and acceptable ſacrifice. Your Maſſe therefore, not being the inſtitution of Chriſt (as I haue already declared), nor yet hauing any ground in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement or worde of God: doth not onely diminiſhe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Chriſt, but is the greateſt diſhonor that man can do to God.</p>
            <p>Your other aſſertion is, that the Maſſe doth aſcribe altogither to Chriſt:<note place="margin">Cypri. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> and therefore is no derogation of the paſſion of Chriſt at all.

Now let the reader take this ſentence hole togither: &amp; iudge whether <hi>Cyprian</hi> do ſpeak here of your Maſſe, or of our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. If you will haue him to ſpeake of your Maſſe: you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your Canon. You muſt blot out al your croſſings, &amp; the reſt of your Rubricks: for Chriſt did vſe none of al thoſe things.

That offering alſo that is made by the handes of the prieſt, is called Chriſtes paſſion, his death, &amp; his crucifying: not according to the truth of the thing, but according to the ſignifying myſtery.

He doth not giue vs water out of this Fountayne, but lyuing bloud: which though it be receyued to teſtifie the Lordes death, yet it is made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, a cauſe of lyfe. But thou doeſt leaue the Fountayne of this bloud, and the cup that is to be had in reuerence: and wyth ſpéede thou renueſt to that deuilliſh Fountayne, that thou mayeſt ſée an Harlot ſwim, and ſuffer ſhipwrack of thine owne ſoule. &amp;c. Thus farre <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſhould proue that the Maſſe is no derogation to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt: but you haue concluded that we receyue lyfe, by receyuing of that which is offered in the Maſſe. If this be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation to Chriſtes paſſion: then is there no derogation of it at
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:9612:169"/> all, in any thing that can be done. For what other thing is the fruite of Chriſtes death, but our euerlaſting lyfe? You had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten your ſelfe bylike, when you alledged thys place: for if <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ment ſo groſſely as you vnderſtand him, he did ſet vp the Maſſe as much to the derogation of Chriſtes paſſion, as poſſibly he could.<note place="margin">Watſon wold not ſee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomes meaning.</note> But <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> had another meaning: then you woulde ſée when you read his wordes. He teacheth the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of <hi>Antioche:</hi> that thoſe holy things that Chriſt giueth to them that be holy, are made vnto them inſtrumentall cauſes of euerlaſting lyfe, yea, euen that myſticall bloud that is receyued to be a teſtimonie of the death of him that is Lorde of lyfe. Thys meaning might you haue ſéene in the wordes of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> if affection had not blinded you.</p>
            <p>But I marueile where you found in <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> words, offered in commemoration: for euen in the Latine text that you your ſelfe cite, it is <hi>Sumitur,</hi> is receyued.

            <p>Theſe authorities therefore doe not proue, that the Maſſe is no derogation to the paſſion of Chriſt: but rather the contrarie.

Where as (Iob was wont to do for his children) the Church of God our mother, being careful for al hir children leaſt any of them by negligence, infirmitie, or wilfulneſſe, haue offended, dayly prayeth and maketh ſacrifice for them, and by that moſt acceptable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie of hir husbandes bodie and bloud, doth mittigate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie god, doth multiply &amp; diſtributeth vnitie.

            </p>
            <p>Two vntruthes you affirme with one breath. One is, that in making your Maſſe a ſacrifice for ſinne:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>CROWLEY.</hi> Two vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with one breath.</note> you doe not make a ſauiour of your owne workes. And the other is: that by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſſe, you declare that you beleue there is no ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our but only Chriſt. And going about to make the matter plaine that it is no vntruth that you affirme: you make it appeare more plaine, that it is moſt falſe that you haue ſayd. You ſay that you do renue and repreſent the paſſion of Chriſt, and that you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Chriſt to his father: and what is this but to make your owne doyngs a ſaluation to your ſelfe. Was not the worke that the prieſtes of the olde lawe wrought in offering ſacrifice for ſinne, accounted the purging of thoſe ſinnes that they offered them for? And why ſhall not your worke in offering Chriſt to his father: be accounted the purging of your ſinne, and ſo conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, your ſauiour? And can it be true that you beleue there is no ſauiour but onely Chriſt: when as miſtruſting the ſufficiencie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes worke once wrought in offering vp himſelfe for the ſinnes of the worlde: you will take vpon you to offer him to his father? For though you ſay that Chriſt hath ordeyned, that you ſhould in ſuch ſort, renue and repreſent his paſſion: yet you are not able to proue it. Wherefore I ſay, you take it vpon you without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſo to doe.

The worke of offering Chriſt to his father, muſt néedes be the worke of ſauing Chriſtes people from their ſinnes therefore: and ſo conſequently your worke in the Maſſe being the offering vp of Chriſt, muſt be a worke of ſauing of Chriſtes people from their ſinnes. But your worke in the Maſſe is not Chriſtes worke in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelf: <hi>Ergo,</hi> you make another ſauiour beſides Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But leaſt you ſhould ſaye that mine argument concludeth not: I will forme you a <hi>Syllogiſmus</hi> according to the rules of Logick. Whoſoeuer doth take vpon him to worke the worke of ſaluation, doth make himſelfe a ſauiour. But you doe take vpon you to worke the worke of ſaluation: <hi>Ergo,</hi> you make your ſelues ſauiours: The <hi>maior</hi> propoſition, is a common knowne truth: allowed of all men.

But you doe ſo: <hi>Ergo,</hi> you take vpon you to worke the worke of ſaluation. And how doe you then declare your ſelues to beléeue, that there is no Sauiour but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Many good things you doe in your Maſſe. You confeſſe your ſinnes. &amp;c.

            <p>Although you therefore, doe in many things well: yet in this one thing, of making the ſacrament a ſacrifice for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the ſoules of Gods people, you doe ſo preſumpteouſly abuſe, both the ſacrament of Chriſt and the name of God, that your hole doing beſide is made abhominable, as the doing of the Deuill coniurers is. When the good people therefore, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this: they will (I doubt not) iudge that you make your owne worke in offering Chriſt to his father, a ſauiour, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another ſauiour beſide Chriſt.</p>
            <p>You beleue (you ſay) that your prayer is of more efficacie and ſtrength in the preſence of Chriſt in the time of the ſacrifice. &amp;c. And here you take <hi>Cyprian</hi> to wytneſſe, when he ſayth: <hi>In huius corporis preſentia. &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in fiue ſeuerall places: How good a foundation theſe places are to builde your fayth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the reader ſhall (I truſt) eaſily perceyue.<note place="margin">Cyprian De Caena.</note> What <hi>Cyprians</hi> meaning was in that ſermon: may well be ſéene in that which I haue written in the aunſwere to the tenth, fiftenth, &amp; thirtie two deuiſions of your former Sermon. As touching thoſe words that you cite here: I muſt tel you that you haue not forgotten your old maner of adding ſomewhat for your purpoſe. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath ſaid: <hi>In huius preſentia.</hi> In his preſence (meaning the preſence of God of whome he had ſpoken before.) And you are ſo bolde as to ſay: <hi>In huius Corporis preſentia,</hi> In the preſence of this body. &amp;c. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had ſayd before. It were better for a man to haue a milſtone faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his necke, and to be caſt into the déepe ſea: then with an vncleane conſcience to receyue a ſop at the Lordes hand. Which doth euen vnto this day create his moſt true and holy body, and doth ſanctifie, and bleſſe and deuide it, to ſuch as doe in godly ſort receyue it. And then folow the wordes that you alledge. In hys preſence, teares doe not begge pardon in vaine: neyther doth the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:9612:173"/> ſacrifice of a contrite hart, at any time ſuffer repulſe. So that <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> meaning is:<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</note> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrifice of a contrite hart, is alwaies accepted in the ſight of God. And although we be alwayes in the ſight of God: yet when we come togither to communicate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſtes inſtitution, we doe preſent our ſelues in the ſight of the Lorde, as the Iſraelites did, when they came to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice before the Arcke of the couenaunt of the Lorde.</p>
            <p>That thys is the meaning of <hi>Cyprian</hi> in thys place: doth appéere by his wordes that folow immediatly after. <hi>Quoties te in conſpectu Domini video. &amp;c.</hi> As often as I doe ſée thée, ſighing in the ſight of the Lorde: I doe not doubt but the holy ghoſt doth breath vpon thée. And when I doe behold thée wéeping: then I doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue him pardoning thy ſinnes. If thou doe defile the temple of the holy ghoſt, if thou defile and make filthy Gods ſanctuarie that is within thée, if thou doe communicate of the cup of Deuilles, with the cup of Chriſt: it is a contumely and not a religion, an iniurie, not a deuotion. It is Idole ſeruice and horible abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: to be wylling to ſerue Baall and Chriſt togither. Stand back with thine Idole chapels, thou that gapeſt after gaines, and foloweſt rewards. &amp;c. I referre it to the iudgement of all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent readers: whether theſe wordes may maintayne your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhe Maſſe or not. Is not your Maſſe ſuch a money matter: that it is growne into a Prouerb? No penie, no <hi>Pater noster.</hi> Such places doe you pick to maintaine your Maſſe.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> you haue found other maner places. In his third Homily vpon the Acts (you ſay) he hath theſe words. <hi>In illa hora. &amp;c.</hi> In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houre. &amp;c.

               </note> could haue no colour of proouing your purpoſe: were it not that you helpe it a little in Engliſhing the Latine of that which foloweth thoſe wordes that you cite in Latine. Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your hearers and readers in hand, that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath ſaid, that Chriſt, euen by the very nature of the ſacrifice, which is his bodie, doth ſtirre vs vp to continuall giuing of thanks: where
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:9612:174"/> as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> maketh no mention at all of Chriſtes bodie in that place,<note place="margin">The ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes body and bloud called our table.</note> but of a kinde of ſacrifice whereby God doth ſtirre vs vp to continuall thankeſgiuing, which is the ſame that before he hath ſayde is made our Table. That is the ſacrament of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud: wherein that ſonne of God that was giuen for vs is liuely repreſented by viſible ſignes, and we moued thereby to be continually thankfull to God, for the lyfe that our ſoules haue by his death.</p>
            <p>By this it doth euidently appeare, that nothing doth more exerciſe our fayth in the knowledge of God and our ſelues, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doeth more increaſe our charitie and hope in the mercy of God: then doth the right vſe of the holy Communion. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Iob in offering ſacrifice for his ſonnes, did ſhewe himſelfe thereby, a louing and carefull father: yet can not we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that ſtrumpet to be our mother, that will make a ſacrifice of hir huſbands heart bloud. For Gods wrath can not be mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with any ſuch ſacrifice. But we are the children of that mother: that acknowledgeth hir ſelfe and all hir Children, to be alreadie waſhed, and made pure and cleane by the bloud of hir huſband, which he in his owne perſon offered, to make both hir and all hir children cleane thereby. And there is nothing that doth more ſet forth the benefite of Chriſt: then doth the right vſe of the ſacrament of this death and bloud ſhedding. For in it wée proteſt, that we haue all thinges by Chriſt: and ſo forth as you haue ſayde of the Maſſe. Which is a méere mans inuention, and no ordinaunce of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other obiections I will but ſhortly touch, for they be of no ſtrength or authoritie, one is this.</hi>
               <note place="margin">WATSON Diuiſion. 31.</note> 
               <hi>There is no mention nor no one worde of any oblation in the ſupper, Ergo Chriſt made no oblation there a goodly reaſon. So there is no mention made neyther of Chriſtes owne mouth nor of any the Euangeliſtes concerning the oblation of the Paſchall lambe, yet we knowe moſt certainely by the olde Teſtament that the Paſchall Lambe was neuer eaten, but it was offered before, which we are ſure Chriſt did obſerue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally,

               <hi>and therefore Chriſt ſayde: <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> doe this, as ye ſee mee doe. But in the forme of our Maſſe, there be expreſſe wordes of offering, for the rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, and for the euidence of the truth. <hi>Vnde &amp; memores nos domini. &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore we thy ſeruauntes, and people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mindfull of thy ſonne Chriſt our Lorde, of his bleſſed paſsion, reſurrection and glorious aſcention, doe offer to thy moſt excellent maieſtie of thy rewardes and giftes, this pure ſacrifice, thys holy and vndefiled ſacrifice, the holye bread of euerlaſting life, &amp; the cup of perpetuall ſaluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There be alſo other wordes of oblation folowing theſe words, ſaint Baſill hath them, Chryſoſtome, ſaint Ambroſe, the generall counſell holden at Epheſus, the lateſt of theſe was a thouſand three hundred yeres ago, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere that it is not newly brought in, as they would ſlaunder it, but the moſt auncient thing in all the Maſſe. They reaſon alſo thus. It is a commemoration, ergo no ſacrifice, as who ſaye the paſchall Lambe being the figure of this, was not both a commemoration and a ſacrifice, for the Lambe was inſtituted to be offered for a memorie of the delyueraunce of the Iewes from the ſworde of the Aungell that ſmote the firſt begotten of the Egiptians, and therefore the Iewes kept this worde of offering the Lambe, for a ſtatute for them and their children for euermore. Euen ſo this Lambe of God that lyeth vpon the table of our aultar is a ſacrifice offered of vs in commemoration of our delyueraunce from the Deuill by the death of Chriſt. In the olde Teſtament
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:9612:175"/> the firſt Lambe offered before their deliuery, &amp; the Lambe which was offered euery yeare after in memory of the ſame deliuery, were verye reall Lambes in deede of one nature and condition: euen ſo the Lambe of God being Chriſt, which Chriſt himſelfe offered in his ſupper, there inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before his death, what we ſhould contynually doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, and that Lambe of God, which we offer now in memorie of our deliueraunce, be very reall Lambes of God in deede, and yet not dyuers in number as the other were, but all one in number, nature, condition and dignitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As Chryſoſtome ſayth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. ad Hebreos ho. <hi>17.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>we offer daylie in commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his death, and the ſacrifice is one, not many. Nor we doe not offer one Lambe now, to morow another, but alwayes the very ſame, or elſe becauſe it is offered in many places, is there many Chriſts? No forſooth, but one Chriſt euery where, here full Chriſt, and there full chriſt, one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, And ſo foorth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You frame our argument after your owne faſhion:<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> and ſo are you the better able to anſwere it. We reaſon thus. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer Chriſt would haue vs do or beleue: is in ſome part of the ſcripture ſo mentioned, that we may plainly perceyue, that it is his wyll that we ſhould doe or beleue the ſame. But there is no ſuch mention in any part of the holy ſcripture, whereby we may perceyue that it is Gods will that we ſhould beleue that Chriſt offered himſelfe in his laſt ſupper, or that he did then inſtitute a ſacrifice wherein we ſhould dayly offer him. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt hath not inſtituted any ſuch ſacrifice as you ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>As for the like reaſons that you would make of the Paſchal Lambe, and Chriſt offering himſelfe vpon the Croſſe, might bée well accepted of ſome of your Auditorie that were of your mind, and therefore blinded by affection. But as many of your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as knowe the ſcriptures, muſt néedes ſay that you might with more honeſty, haue kept them ſtill in your boſome. For who knoweth not, that Chriſt himſelfe hath ſayd. <hi>Non veni ſoluere le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, ſed adimplere. Et qui ſoluerit vnum ex mandatis iſtis minimis: mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimus
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:9612:176"/> vocabitur in Regno coelorum.</hi> I came not to breake the lawe, but to fulfil it.<note place="margin">

As by the ſinne of one, condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came vpon all: ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one came the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of life. And againe. He offered himſelfe vnto God without ſpot. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The concluſion that you would haue vs make, doth verye well. For by that concluſion you confeſſe, that Chriſts offering of himſelfe in his ſupper was a viſible Action: and that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his diſciples to do as they ſawe him doe. Then, eyther he made thrée croſſes vpon the cup and bread togither,<note place="margin">The forme of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Maſſe.</note> and again, thrée croſſes vppon them both togither, and one croſſe vpon the bread, and one vpon the cup, and then one vpon the bread brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out fiue wordes vpon it, and then one vpon the cup, lifting vp and laying downe. &amp;c. or elſe the Maſſe that you haue in the popiſhe Church, is not that which Chriſt did then inſtitute.</p>
            <p>You haue graunted now, that in Chriſtes inſtitution, there is no word of offering: but in your forme of Maſſe (you ſay) you haue expreſſe wordes of offering. We would faine know then, where you had thoſe wordes. You ſay that <hi>Baſil, Chryſoſtome, Ambroſe,</hi> and the generall counſaile at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> had them: and the lateſt of theſe was <hi>.1300.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diuiſione. <hi>9.</hi> Cyprian. li. <hi>2.</hi> Epistol. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> yeares ago. But the Chronicles will pull you backe an hundred yeares and more. But what if all theſe had it: doeth this proue that Chriſt had it? In your other ſermon you coulde cite a rule out of <hi>Cyprian</hi> that was nighe hand <hi>.200.</hi> yeares before the eldeſt of the foure that you named nowe: wherein he ſayth. <hi>In ſacrificio quod Chriſtus eſt: non niſi Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dus eſt.</hi> In that ſacrifice which is Chriſt: none but Chriſt is to be folowed. If you can not proue therefore that Chriſt vſed thoſe toyes that you do vſe in your Maſſe: you ought not, by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> rule, to vſe them, though neuer ſo many haue vſed them before you. And if it can not be proued by ſcripture, that Chriſt made a ſacrifice of himſelf in his ſupper: you may not make a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:9612:176"/> of him in your Maſſe. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But it is ſufficient for your purpoſe, that you haue proued, that it is not ſo newly brought in, as we woulde ſlaunder, but it is the moſt auncient thing in the Maſſe. Well, graunt it be ſo. Yet is neither that nor your Maſſe ſo auncient as you woulde make it: nor ſo auncient that we may take it for Chriſtes inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And all theſe that you haue named doe ſpeake of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and not of a Maſſe, and do cal it a ſacrifice, for ſuch cauſe as I haue often declared in this aunſwere.</p>
            <p>To our other reaſon you ſay, that it is both a commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a ſacrifice: as the Paſchall Lambe was. Our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in this forme.<note place="margin">A comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of any thing, is not that thing.</note> Whatſoeuer is the commemoration of a thing: is not, neyther can be the thing it ſelfe whereof it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I am ſure all the Logique you haue can not proue this a good Argument.</p>
            <p>That Chriſt offered himſelfe in his laſt ſupper, you haue not yet proued: much leſſe haue you proued, that he did then inſtitute any ſacrifice, wherein we ſhould continually offer him.

If ye take it for the thing offered, which is the bodye of Chriſt, who can iuſtly denie but that the body of Chriſt is a ſacrifice propitiatorie, ſeing ſaint Iohn ſayth, he is the propitiation for our ſinnes, euer was and euer ſhall be, and neuer ceaſe ſo to be, till our ſinnes be ended,</hi>

This Sophiſtrie therefore is none of mine: wherefore, I may be bolde to call him a Sophiſter, that vſeth diſtinctions, to cauſe things that are falſe, to ſéeme true, as you doe in this place vſe two diſtinctions.

In the <hi>.17.</hi> Chap. he doth put it in the power of man, to deſerue the kingdome of heauen. Which ſentence, <hi>Auſten</hi> doth in all places deteſt. And yet the ſame wryter doth in the <hi>.22.</hi> Chapter, ſay the contrary. Such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged matter is méete for the proufe of the propiciation of your Maſſe, for the ſinnes both of the quicke and the dead.</p>
            <p>You haue miſtaken the place that you alledge out of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome.</hi> For vpon the firſt Chapter to <hi>Titus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hiero. in Cap. <hi>1.</hi> ad Titum.</note> he wryteth not one worde that may be wreſted to ſuch a meaning, as thoſe wordes haue that you cite. But he hath wordes there to the contrary of that, whereof (you ſay) you might proue the chaſt life of a biſhop.</p>
            <p>Of what authoritie the Maſſe of <hi>Baſill</hi> is,<note place="margin">Baſilius in Miſſa.</note> I haue noted in mine aunſwere to the ninth diuiſion of your former ſermon, and néede not now to trouble the reader any more with that matter. and thus we can not ſée by that light that you haue hitherto gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs: that the Maſſe is a ſacrifice propiciatorie, for the ſinnes of them that be aliue.</p>
            <p>Nowe a little you haue to ſay, concerning them that be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted: and then an ende of that matter. <hi>Tertulian</hi> ſayth (ſay
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:9612:184"/> you) <hi>Oblationes pro defunctis. &amp;c.</hi> We make euery yeare oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the dead.<note place="margin">De corona Militis.</note> &amp;c. I will ſet downe in wryting the ſentence that goeth before, and that which foloweth immediatly after: that the indifferent Reader may weigh altogither, and iudge of the wryters meaning. <hi>Euchariſtiae ſacramentum, &amp; in tempore victus, &amp; omnibus mandatum à domino: etiam antilucanis coetibus, nec de alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum manibus, quam praeſidentium ſumimus. Oblationes pro defunctis, pro natalitijs, annua die facimus. Die dominico, ieiunium nefas ducimus, vel geniculis adorare.</hi> We do receyue the ſacrament of thankeſgiuing, both in the time of repaſt or féeding, and at all times that the lord hath commaunded, yea and in our comming togither before day: not at the hand of any other, then of ſuch as be in authoritie. We do in the yerely day make oblation for the deade, for theyr birth dayes. We thinke it wickedneſſe to faſt on the Lordes day, or to bowe the knées.</p>
            <p>This oblation might be, the receyuing of the Communion togither: in that yerely day wherein they vſed to ſolemnize a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe that had giuen their liues for Chriſtes cauſe. Which the fathers might well cal an oblation: becauſe they vſed at ſuch méetinges, to offer of their goods to the reliefe of the poore, and themſelues to ſuffer for Chriſt, as they whoſe memoriall they celebrated, had done before. But how like you the cuſtome of that time, which was to refraine knéeling on the ſunday, as a wickedneſſe? And howe like you that he calleth the ſacrifice that you ſpeake of: the ſacrament of thankeſgiuing? Here is no worde of propitiation for ſinnes. Wherefore this little that you had to ſay out of <hi>Tertulian,</hi> is as much as neuer a whit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſayth <hi>Intelligimus animas peccatorum. &amp;c.</hi> We vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,<note place="margin">Athanaſius ad Antioch. Principem. Queſt. <hi>34.</hi>
               </note> that the ſoules of ſinners. &amp;c. Howe farre vnlike it is, that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Archbiſhop of Alexandria, ſhould be Authour of theſe queſtions and aunſweres: may eaſily appere to as many as will with iudgement read them, and conſider the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he liued, and the matter conteyned in the aunſweres. Firſt it is to be conſidered: that he liued about <hi>.330.</hi> yeares after Chriſt. Then that he was of the Gréeke Church: and therefore wrote as a Gretian: theſe things kept in memorie, and the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:9612:184"/> in ſome of the aunſweres conſidered: it will appere that ſome <hi>Athanaſius</hi> of a later tyme was Authour of theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and aunſweres.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond aunſwere, he ſayth, that in his tyme, the feaſt of the Epiphanie of our Lorde, was called the feaſt of the thrée kings: where as <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who liued an hundred yeares after him, and being biſhop of <hi>Millaine</hi> (whether the bones of thoſe thrée, if hyſtories be true, were firſt brought out of <hi>Perſia</hi>) doth make no mention of any ſuch feaſt, notwithſtanding that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of Lukes Goſpell, he doth ſpeake of their comming out of the Eaſt to ſéeke Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the aunſwere to the thirde queſtion: he alleageth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who was not ſo auncient as he himſelfe was (if he were the right <hi>Athanaſius</hi>) and he giueth him titles of great authoritie, acknowledging him to be a father of him and other of his tyme, and a worker of myracles.</p>
            <p>In the aunſwere to the <hi>.14.</hi> queſtion, he ſayth, that men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be beleued, that were ſpirite coniurers, had tolde him, that they had ſéene the Deuill in his owne likeneſſe: and that he had tolde them, that there is no ſentence in all the ſcripture that is more terrible to him, then the beginning of the <hi>.67.</hi> Pſalme. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urgat deus. &amp;c.</hi> Let God ariſe, and his enimies ſhall be ſcattered abroade.</p>
            <p>And the reaſons, that (in the aunſwere that you alledge) he ſheweth, whereby we doe vnderſtande, that ſinners ſoules haue ſome benefite, by thinges done for them after they be departed: are not ſuch as ſhould mooue ſo wiſe and learned men as <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> was. One is, the vſage and cuſtome of doing things for them: which (ſayth he) if it were no commotitie to them, would not be continued. The other is the nature of wine, which (as hée ſayth) being faſt cloſed in a veſſell, will when it féeleth the odour or ſauour of the vine that beginneth to budde in the field: budde with the vine, and begin to flouriſhe a freſhe. Euen ſo (ſayth he) we vnderſtand. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus the indifferent reader may ſée, that I do not without iuſt cauſe reiect this authoritie that you alledge in the name of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9612:185"/> 
               <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For aunſwere to that which you report of ſaint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> exhorting the people to pray for <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour.<note place="margin">Ambroſ. De obit. valent.

               </note>To the other thrée places that you alledge out of <hi>Auſten:</hi> I muſt aunſwere thus. It appeareth by theſe thrée, and certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of ſaint <hi>Auſtens</hi> workes: that he ſuppoſed, that prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made, and almoſe déedes done, for ſuch as departed this lyfe in the fayth of Chriſt, and felowſhip of the members of his body: might be propitiatorie for them, in ſuch ſort as you haue ſayde that your Maſſe is, when it is taken for the worke of the prieſt. And that the reaſon that perſwaded him ſo to thinke, was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Church in his dayes: which was to make mention of the dead in their prayers, when according to Chriſtes inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they did celebrate the holye Communion of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But ſhall this be a ſufficient warrant for vs: to thinke and to teache that the Maſſe, which (as it is vſed in the Popes church) is but an heape of dumble ceremonies, is a ſacrifice propiciatorie, for the ſinnes both of the quicke and the dead? The ſame <hi>Auſten</hi> willeth vs not to ſtand vpon his warrandice: but to be ſure that we haue the ſcripture for our diſcharge. For he knewe himſelfe to be a man: and that as a man he might erre. In his thirde booke <hi>De trinitate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Prooemio li. <hi>3.</hi> de Trinit.</note> he ſayth thus. <hi>Noli meis litteris quaſi ſcripturis canonicis enſeruire, ſed in illis &amp; quod non credebas cum inueneris incunctanter cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de: in iſtis autem, quod certum non habebas, niſi certum intellexeris, noli firmiter retenere.</hi> Be not bound to my wrytings, as to the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ſcriptures, but when thou ſhalt finde in them that which thou diddeſt not beleue before, beleue it without any ſtaying or

            <p>Againe in one of thoſe bookes that you alledge, he ſayth.<note place="margin">Euchiridio. Capit. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Quae autem nec corporeo ſenſu experti ſumus, nec mente aſsequi valuimus aut valemus: eis ſine vlla dubitatione credenda ſunt teſtibus, à quibus ea quae diuina vocari iam meruit ſcriptura, confecta eſt.</hi> But thoſe thinges which we neither haue proued by bodily ſenſe, nor haue béene or are able to attaine vnto by reaſon: muſt without any doubting be beleued, for thoſe witneſſes, of whom that ſcripture that is nowe worthily called diuine, was perfectly made.</p>
            <p>And in another place he ſayth.<note place="margin">De Peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum merit. li. <hi>1.</hi> Capit. <hi>22.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Cedamus igitur &amp; conſentiamus authoritati ſcripturae ſanctae: quae neſcit falli, nec fallere.</hi> Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giue place and conſent to the authoritie of the holy ſcripture: which neyther can be diſceyued nor diſceyue.</p>

If Chriſt therefore haue not taught that which we teach: euen we our ſelues doe iudge it deteſtable.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſentences and ſuch like (whereof there be many in the auncient fathers wrytings) do cauſe me not to conſent to that which <hi>Auſten</hi> wryteth in thoſe places that you alledge, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other of his workes. Although the ſame be nothing to proue that which you would proue by his authoritie.</p>
            <p>He maketh the oblation, whereof he ſpeaketh there, of no greater worthineſſe, then the almoſe that is giuen to the poore, and the prayers made for the dead: wherefore, he can not meane there of ſuch a ſacrifice as you make your Maſſe when you ſay it is Chriſt himſelfe: There is great oddes, betwéene Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, offering himſelfe to his father, and a loafe of bread, giuen to an hungrie man. It is manifeſt therefore, that he vnderſtandeth that oblation that he ſpeaketh of, to be but a meane to mooue God to applie the merites of his ſonne, to ſuch as whiles they liued
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:9612:186"/> here, did by repentaunce and fayth, make themſelues méete to be partakers of mercie. For ſo he teacheth in plaine wordes, in the ſame place that you cite, ſaying. <hi>Sed eis haec proſunt, que cum viue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, vt haec ſibi poſtea prodeſsè poſſent meruerunt.</hi> But theſe things are profitable to ſuch perſons, as whilſt they liued here, deſerued that theſe things might afterward be profitable to them.</p>
            <p>Yea, if all be <hi>Auſtens</hi> that goeth in his name: there is no propiciation to be had for capitall ſinnes, after this life. His wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des be theſe.<note place="margin">Sermone. <hi>41.</hi> de ſanct.</note> 
               <hi>Non capitalia: ſed minuta paccata purgantur.</hi> Not the capitall, or damnable ſinnes are purged: but the ſmall ſinnes. Such as the Italians call <hi>Peccadulians,</hi> little pretie ſinnes. Yea, and thoſe little ſinnes (ſayth he) if the fardell of them be great: will weigh you downe and drowne you.</p>
            <p>And to giue men occaſion to thinke, that he had no great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, to this doctrine of helping the ſoules departed: he writeth thus,<note place="margin">Lucae. <hi>16.</hi> Auguſt. in Pſalm. <hi>48.</hi>
               </note> by the occaſion of the hiſtorie or parable of the rich man and Lazarus. <hi>Ventri ſuo ſeruiunt homines: non ſpiritibus ſuorum. Ad ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus mortuorum ſuorum, non peruenit: niſi quod ſecum viui fecerunt.</hi> Men ſayth he, (meaning ſuch as offer ſacrifice for the deade) doe not ſerue the ſpirites of their friends: but their owne bellies. To the ſpirites of their friends departed, there commeth nothing: more then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they did whilſt they liued here with them. Here you may ſée, how little help you haue by ſaint <hi>Auſtens</hi> words: when they be better weighed, then you would weigh them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you did vſe them. And when his wordes in other partes of his workes, be weighed alſo. Yea, you may ſée by this place of <hi>Auſten:</hi> that your purgatory prieſts, which are hyred to ſing for ſoules, doe not ſerue the ſoules that they ſing for, but their owne bellies. And therefore the coſt that is beſtowed that way: is but caſt away.</p>
            <p>The ſcripture, that neyther is deceyued nor doth deceyue: hath told vs, that we ſhall all ſtand before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 14.</note> and receyue according to thoſe works that we haue done in our owne bodies, whether the ſame be good or badde. And the ſcripture hath willed vs to worke righteouſneſſe before we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part hence: for in the graue, there can no foode be founde.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore, that though you could ſpend <hi>.22.</hi> houres,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9612:186"/> in rehearſing of the places that you could bring in for this poynt: yet ſhould they not all be woorth a poynt, becauſe the ſcripture is againſt them. So that wée may ſée that it is moſt vntrue, that the Maſſe is a ſacrifice propiciatorie, for the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead. And that it is moſt true, that there is none other propiciation for mans ſinne: but that onely, that was once for al wrought by Chriſt in his owne perſon vpon the Croſſe. And that the ſame is ſtill, and ſhall be for euer, effectuall to all that beleue the promiſe that God made therein.</p>

For although the prieſt in the conſecration may haue his thoughtes diſtract to ſome other thing, and ſo lack attention, which is a great negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the worke of God, and deadly ſinne to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: yet if he lacke intention not intending to doe that God commaundeth and the Church doth: there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration nor no ſacrament at all. And for this point what intention ſhall we thinke theſe men had of late that vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied to conſecrate or receyue Chriſtes body &amp; bloud vnder the formes of bread and wine, but onely to receyue the creatures of bread and wine, and thereby to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Chriſtes body and bloud?

You ſay ſaint Thomas doth vſe it ſo: but you tel vs not where. But though ſaint Thomas do vſe it ſo: yet muſt we know him to be a more approued Latiniſt, before we
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:9612:190"/> folow him, and make him our authour in ſo waightie a matter as this. <hi>Cicero,</hi> and other approued authours doe vſe it, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to publike and common,<note place="margin">Solemne is not contrary to priuate.</note> but neuer as contrarie to ſolemne as you ſay ſaint Thomas doth. <hi>Solennis</hi> is properly that, which is vſed but once euery yeare: and that at a time certaine and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed. The contrarie to that, muſt néedes be the thing that is neuer ſo vſed: but oftener or ſeldomer, as occaſion is offred. You ſay we ſpeake agaynſt that, we knowe not what, and we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in our owne imagination: but we can proue that you are deceyued by your fooliſhe imitation. Your barbarous babling lawiers, haue vſed a worde of their owne making, in ſuch ſort as you would vſe <hi>Solennis,</hi> making it contrary to <hi>Priuus:</hi> and they ſay, <hi>ſolempnizare matrimoniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> for <hi>celebrare matrimonium.</hi> To celebrate mariage, or to make an open contract of mariage, in the open face of the Church. The imitation of theſe eloquent Latiniſts: hath deceyued both you and ſaint Thomas, if he wryte as you report of him.</p>
            <p>As for your Gréeke worde, you might full well haue ſpared, vnleſſe it had made more for your purpoſe: for nothing is more contrarie to that which is done by one alone, and to himſelfe, then <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>, is. For you your ſelfe ſay it is a publike miniſterie: which can not be your Maſſe, when the prieſt miniſtreth to none but to himſelf, though he do it in the preſence of ten thouſand, and at the high altare in ſaint Peters Church at Rome, and on ſaint Peters day. It may be ſayde, that it is openly done, and ſo is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly the contrary: but it cannot be truely ſayd to be publikely done, becauſe it is done but by one, and to himſelfe alone. Yea, though there were a ſmall number that did communicate with the prieſt, in the preſence of a great number that were not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with them: yet ſhoulde it not be publike, becauſe it is not common to as many as it ſhould be common vnto. So farre of is your Gréeke worde: from proouing your priuate Maſſe to bée publike.</p>
            <p>Who they be that can well away with your Maſſe, but not with your priuate Maſſe you tell vs not: but I tell you, that I haue ſayd, and doe ſay, <hi>Sine fine,</hi> without ceaſing, that your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate

But your priuate Maſſe lacketh one of them, that is Participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is againſt the inſtitution of Chriſt. The participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of prayers, oblation, and merites, will not ſerue here. There muſt be participation of that which is conſecrated, that is, the bread and wine. But that is not in your priuate Maſſe, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. Say not now that we neuer proue, that your priuate Maſſe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtes inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Thus going about to proue your negatiue: you haue mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred matter to proue our affirmatiue. Well you procéede to the foure things that are required in the due conſecration. The firſt, is neceſſarie matter, &amp;c. We ſay as you doe, that the neceſſarye matter is breade, made of ſuch graine as is vſuall in the place, which commonly is wheate: and wine made of Grapes. But that the bread muſt of neceſſitie be vnleauened, &amp; the wine mixed with water: we do in plaine wordes denie. And yet do wée not rayſe vp againe any rotten Hereſie at all.

And for the water he ſayth alſo. <hi>Dicendum quod admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio aquae ad viuum non eſt de neceſsitate ſacramenti.</hi> We muſt ſaye, that the mingling of the water with the wine: is not of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie

            <p>And ſaint Thomas ſayth, that ſaint <hi>Gregorie</hi> maketh the matter plaine,<note place="margin">Gregorius in Regeſt.</note> for the libertie that we teach in this matter.

Sed certae Eccleſiae offerunt fermentatum: pro eo quod verbum patris indutum eſt carne, ſicut fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum miſcetur farinae.

But certaine Churches doe offer leauened bread: becauſe the worde of the father (that is the ſonne of God) hath taken vpon him, fleſhe, euen as leauen is mingled with meale. Wherefore, euen as that prieſt, that in the Latine Church doth celebrate with leauened bread doth ſinne:<note place="margin">Both ſinne a like.</note> ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſt that in the Gréeke Church doth celebrate with vnleauened bread, doth ſinne alſo, as peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cuſtome of his Church.</p>
            <p>It is to be wondred at, that you will teach a doctrine ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Gods Vicare on earth: and make ſo great a matter, of that which he ſetteth ſo light.

Some ſay, <hi>Hoc,</hi> this: is it that worketh all. Some ſay, <hi>Est,</hi> is: And ſome ſay, <hi>vin.</hi> The firſt ſillable, the Verbe copulatiue, or the laſt ſillable.</p>
            <p>There is no ſuch diſagréeing founde in your newe maiſters wrytings or examples. Wherfore, you are worthy to come out of a good ſchoole, that can cary ſuch vntrue reports out of the ſchoole: and if euer you come in againe to be well whipt, for belying your maiſters. For we doe not vnder pretence of maynteyning the inſtitution of Chriſt, deſtroy, denie, or defraude it: but in a true zeale, we aboliſhe all ſuperſtition brought in by man, and vſe that conſecration onely, that Chriſt vſed, and taught to be vſed of hys.</p>
            <p>The miniſter we allowe not, vnleſſe he be called and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according to the worde of God. If any be vnworthy that be admitted or ſuffered in the miniſterie: the fault is not in the order that your new maiſters profeſſe to folow,<note place="margin">Popiſhe ſhauelings moſt vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy miniſters</note> but in the officers that haue the execution of the order. And if it were in mine hand: I would ridde the Church of a greater number of your ſhaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, which are moſt vnworthy, though you thinke none wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy but ſuch. As for the ſaying of <hi>Arnobius,</hi> we regarde it as well as you doe: as may be ſéene by that which I haue written in mine aunſwere to the <hi>.30.</hi> diuiſion of your former Sermon.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing that you ſay is required in your due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, is the intent of your miniſter: which muſt be to doe as the Church doth,<note place="margin">The ſure ſtay that the Popiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration hath to leane to.</note> without mocking, diſſimulation, or contrarie purpoſe. And where this is not: there is no conſecration at all. You haue brought your matter to a good point now, your conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration may not be doubted of: for it hangeth vpon the prieſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. If he intend not to do as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church doth, but to huddle vp his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:9612:192"/> Maſſe for his hyer: then they that gaped for Gods body, haue caught but a Waffer cake, as lyght as a Butter flie. And they that gaue him money, to offer Chriſt for their friendes depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: haue loſt both labour and coſt, for Chriſt came not into hys clowches to be offered. And whatſoeuer thing elſe, ſhould haue bene wrought by that Maſſe, is cleane diſappointed: ſauing only that the prieſt hath his money, and the peoples folly is fed. A more vncertaine thing can there not be: then when all hangeth vpon that which no man can know, but he only that is the doer. Wiſe men therefore, will ſéeke a more ſure ſtay to leane too, then your conſecration can be: ſeing it hath not a better and more certaine foundation, then the moſt vncertaine intent of the prieſt.</p>
            <p>What intent we had or haue: God doth knowe, and ſhall iudge. Our doings doe declare: that we intend to vſe the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt, according to hys holye inſtitution,<note place="margin">The effect of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of his death and paſſion. And by them to call to memory what we are by Chriſt, &amp; what we muſt continue to the end, and what we ſhall haue in the ende. And being ſuch as by receyuing thoſe holy myſteries together, we ſéeme to be: we are by them aſſured: that Chriſt dwelleth in vs, and we in him. And that as the creatures bread and wine, doe by the mouth enter into our bodies to be the foode thereof: ſo doe the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt by fayth enter into our ſoules, to be the ſuſtinaunce of them, whereby both body and ſoule ſhall lyue for euer in ioy.</p>
            <p>And in our laſt booke of Communion: our inuocation is ſome thing more large then you haue reported it. For we ſaye thus. Heare vs, O mercyfull father, we beſech thée. And graunt that we receyuing theſe thy creatures of bread and wine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy ſonne our ſauiour Chriſtes holye inſtitution, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of his death and paſſion: may be partakers of his moſt bleſſed body and bloud. &amp;c. If you would haue conſidered this inuocation better: you ſhould not haue néeded to haue wylled your auditorie, to looke throughout the ſcriptures, to finde where Chriſt did inſtitute, that by eating of bread and wine, men ſhould be partakers of his bodie and bloud. For the wordes of our inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are: that we doing that which Ieſus Chriſt did will to be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:9612:193"/> done, for ſuch purpoſe as he did appoynt it to be do ne: may bée partakers of the thing in déede, that is repreſented by that which is done. Not by the outwarde act that we do: but by the inwarde fayth that mooueth vs to doe it, being commaunded by him in whom we beleue.</p>
            <p>The inſtitution of this doing, is declared immediately after the inuocation that you ſpeake of:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> and was written by S. Paule to the Corinthes. Wherefore, we do not beare men in hand that Chriſt did inſtitute that which he neuer thought: neither doe our déedes ſhewe, that we be enimies to his inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as they vſed themſelues in conſecration: ſo they did in the oblation,</hi>

               <hi>which they did not corrupt as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but vtterly tooke away, denying any ſuch thing to be, as I haue proued it is, in ſo much that in all their newe communion, they could not ſcarcely abide the name or worde of oblation, but pulled it out of the booke, ſo much did they fauour the inſtitution of Chriſt which they nowe pretende.</hi>

               <hi>But ſuch thinges as pertaine to the ceremonie of the eating, as how many in one place togither, what time, place maner, order, and ſuch like, be thinges pertayning to the ordinaunce and direction of the Church, and not to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, as neceſſary vpon paine of damnation to be obſerued of euery chriſten man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For elſe if all the rites that Chriſt vſed at hys ſupper were of neceſsitie and pertayning to his inſtitution: then there muſt needes be thirtene together at the communion and neyther moe nor fewer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it muſt be celebrate after ſupper, and in the night, after the waſhing of the feete, and in a Parler or Chamber, and all that receaue muſt be prieſts and no women. For all theſe things were obſerued of Chriſt and his Apoſtles at his laſt ſupper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for our inſtruction to declare that they be not fixed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:9612:194"/> by the inſtituted of Chriſt, but left to the diſpoſition of the Church, the Church hath taken an other order in theſe things, wylling that all ſhall communicate that be worthy and diſpoſed.

               <hi>Yet ſay they, Chriſt did not receyue it alone, but did communicate with his twelue Apoſtles, whoſe example we ought to folow.

That it ſhould bee receaued of vs, is Chriſtes example ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, but of howe many, of twelue onely, of moe, of fewer, or of one, is not by Chriſtes example fixed and determyned.</hi>

But we miniſtring it not for that intent to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the ſacrament, and to make prieſtes, but to receyue the ſpirituall fruite that commeth to vs thereby, are not boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:9612:194"/> to obſerue that number, but ſhall doe well if we receaue it eyther with other or alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You haue falſely charged vs with taking awaye the due matter. &amp;c.<note place="margin">CROWLEY.</note> And as for the leauing out of the principall verbe <hi>(Eſt)</hi> Let him be charged withall that did it.<note place="margin">Narow ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for matters to charge vs with.</note> It is like that you haue little to charge vs with, when you ſeeke out the printers faultes, and lay them to our charge: and yet confeſſe in plaine wordes that the fault is corrected. If I would haue delt to with you: I might haue done it many tymes in theſe your ſermons, as may well appeare to the learned that will reade them as you ſet them out in print. Our miniſters be ordered and admitted, with impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or laying on of handes and prayer: and as many ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies beſide, as may tende to edification. And that which we do in the miniſtration of the worde and ſacraments: ſhall neuer bée iuſtly diſproued by any of your ſort, to be other then the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt. Our intent in doing that we doe, is to imitate the Church of Chriſt: and not the Church of Antichriſt, which is the Church of Rome. Wee offer that oblation: which both by the ſcriptures and fathers, is accepted for the ſacrifice of the newe teſtament. And our Communion (which it pleaſeth you to terme bare) ſhall on the mariage day be interteyned of the Bridegro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes father:<note place="margin">The Maſſe hath not the marige gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> when your Maſſe ſhall be turned out for lacke of a mariage garment. We haue no cauſe therfore to be abaſhed ſtill to crie vpon Chriſtes inſtitution: which you haue and doe ſtill, in ſo many poynts violate and breake as appereth by that which I haue anſwered to that which you haue ſhewed, proouing that which we haue, to be the inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And where as you go about to render a reaſon, and make a proufe, that the Communion that we haue is not the inſtitution of Chriſt, ſaying that the vſe of the ſacrament is, that it ſhoulde be receyued. &amp;c. I marueil if you did not bluſhe when you ſpake it. For if that be the vſe of the ſacrament (as it is in déede) howe dare you reſerue it, and hange it ouer your altar, ſometime, till it be ſo vinewed and mowled, that you muſt nedes burne it? how dare you carie it about your ſtréetes in proceſſion? And how dare
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:9612:195"/> you fetch it out in tempeſts: to ſcare the deuill withall? Yea, how dare you put it in a purſe and hange it about your necke, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue you from perilles?</p>
            <p>And I pray you, what mooued you to vſe this reaſon againſt vs:<note place="margin">Nothing more againſt Watſon then this is.</note> ſeing that you know that we do neuer miniſter it, but when we haue occaſion preſently to diſtribute it, ſo that we neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it for any maner of purpoſe? There is nothing that maketh more againſt your doynges: then that which in this place you alledge againſt vs. Take, eate, drinke. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And where you ſay that the ceremonies and rites that be vſed about the miniſtration of the ſacrament, doe not appertaine to the inſtitution of Chriſt, we ſay ſo to: and that therefore the Church ought not to make a matter of neceſſitie of them, but leaue them to the diſcretion of euery particuler congregation, to vſe or leaue them, as they ſhall ſée that they doe tend to theyr edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or not.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Watſons purpoſe in ſpeaking of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances.</note>Much a doe you make about circumſtaunces of the eating, and the number of them that ſhall eate, the tyme, place. &amp;c: but all is to make ſome ſhewe of a libertie left to the Church, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine that one alone may in the preſence of a multitude, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate that ſacrament, and receyue it alone, as commonly your Maſſing prieſtes do. But it will not be. For not onely the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt in his laſt ſupper is to the contrary, but his words in the inſtitution alſo: which wordes we muſt hearken vnto, and not thoſe circumſtaunces which are not within the compaſſe of doe this in remembraunce of me. He tooke breade, gaue thankes, brake it (that is, he deuided it amongſt them) and ſayd, take, eate, this is my bodie: and in like maner the cup, ſaying, drinke ye all of this, do this in remembraunce of me.</p>
            <p>If any of them had béene ſo dull of vnderſtanding, as you ſhewe your ſelfe to be: and woulde haue mooued this néedeleſſe queſtion, what ſhall we doe in remembraunce of thée? Woulde he not haue ſayd, take breade, giue thankes, deuide it amongeſt you, and eate it: for it is my bodie? And in like maner, take a cup of wine, giue thankes, and drinke all of it: for it is my bloud? And what libertie is here left to the Church to ordaine that the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:9612:195"/> prieſt alone, may do this to himſelfe in the preſence of a multitude that ſhould be partakers with him, as the Apoſtles were wyth Chriſt?</p>
            <p>The place that you cite out of <hi>Auſten,</hi> is wreſted too farre out of tune. For in that place he ſpeaketh onely of the time of miniſtration and receyuing. Whether before meats or after: as appeareth by the wordes that folow immediatly after. <hi>Nam ſi hoc ille. &amp;c.</hi> For if he had tolde his diſciples this, that this ſacrament ſhould alwayes be receyued after meates: I beleue that no man would haue altered that cuſtome. So farre of is ſaint <hi>Auſten,</hi> from confirming the priuate receyuing of your prieſt. Wherfore you gather more of his wordes then he ment. But this vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage you haue giuen vs by the wordes of your collection: that we may be bolde to ſaye, that in your Maſſe there is nothing of Chriſtes inſtitution, more then the receyuing of the ſacrament. The reſt is ordered by the Church. But you woulde faine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine your ſaying to the number of receyuers: and therefore you ſay, and other rites of the receyuing.</p>
            <p>You imagine,<note place="margin">We depende vpon chriſtes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> that we depende altogither vpon the example of Chriſt, in communicating with the twelue: but I haue tolde you before, that we depende not onely vpon his example in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but alſo, and chiefely, vpon his wordes in commaunding. Which wordes are, that not only twelue and no mo: but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as be chriſtians and will be preſent at the action, ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the myſteries. And that the action ſhould be celebrated by the Congregation, that deſire to be partakers thereof in the remembraunce of Chriſtes death and paſſion, and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The neceſſitie that you ſay draue Chriſt to miniſter to mee then to himſelfe: either fighteth holye agaynſt your purpoſe, or elſe one part of it agaynſt another. It was neceſſarie (ſay you) that by his déede he ſhould inſtitute the thing: and teach his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, what they ſhould do afterwarde in the commemoration of his death. How this can agrée with your purpoſe, and with the reſt that you write there: let the diſcrete reader iudge. And how well you doe, when you receyue and miniſter this ſacrament to your ſelfe alone.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:9612:197"/> doe plainely preache vnto vs, which is our lincking togither into the felowſhip of members of one body, and our euerlaſting lyfe through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This doing of theires, as it doth declare a diſtruſt in their owne ſtrength, ſo it is not to be miſlyked: but as it doth declare to great a truſt in the outwarde myſteries of Chriſt, ſo it can not be of the godly wiſe, well lyked.</p>
            <p>When the Iſraelites ſawe their owne inhabilitie to ſtande before their enimies,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Regum.</hi> 4.</note> they ſent for the Arcke of God, that by the preſence thereof, they might be encouraged and made able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome them: but when they had it amongſt them, they were ouerthrowne with a greater ſlaughter than before, and the Arcke of God (wherein they truſted) caried away from them by their enimies.<note place="margin">De Lapſis Sermone. <hi>5.</hi>

The Byſhops of Rome before <hi>Victor,</hi> did vſe ſolemnly to ſend the ſacrament to Biſhops of thoſe Churches, that did not obſerue Eaſter and Lent faſt, as the Church of Rome did. And ſo they did communicate togither: though they were not in one place togither. What maketh this to proue that a prieſt may ſay a priuate Maſſe: and delyuer no part of the ſacrament to other? To ſignifie, that they breake not the bond of vnitie, though they diſſented about the time of Eaſter and Lent faſt: they did, when they communicated, reſerue ſome part of the ſacrament. And by meſſengers worthy of credit: they ſent the ſame to thoſe Byſhops, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in thoſe trifling matters were not of their minde.

            <p>Theſe ſayings of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> may giue vs occaſion to thinke, that the vſage of the Byſhops in thoſe dayes: was rather to ſend common bread from one to another, then bread alreadie conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated.

Well, I leaue the iudgement of this, to the godly wiſe.</p>

Leaſt ſuch therefore, ſhould lack the comfortable conſolation of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſuch extremitie: ſome part of the ſacrament was reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be giuen them in ſuch caſe. Shall thys prooue, that your Maſſing prieſtes doe communicate, when they delyuer no part of the ſacrament to any other, but conſume the whole themſelues? I thinke no wiſe man will thinke it.</p>
            <p>This hyſtorie might well haue bene left amongſt that great number of other that you ſay make for this purpoſe: for it doth make more againſt the higheſt matter of all, then for that which you alledge it for. What opinion thinke you, had that prieſt of the ſacrament: when he would delyuer it to <hi>Serapion</hi> his boy, &amp; bid him dip it, and giue it to the olde man? Did he thinke that it was the very reall body and bloud of Chriſt, and that there remayned in it neyther bread nor wine? The Cautiles of your Maſſe doe

Is it reaſon, that the prieſt whoſe lyfe is wholy dedicate to the ſeruice of God, and to pray for the people, ſhould ſinne deadly, if he did ioyne himſelfe more and more to Chriſt by receyuing daylie the ſpirituall foode of his body and bloud, becauſe the people that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly occupie their life in the affayres of the world be not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:9612:201"/> worthy, or not diſpoſed daylie to receaue with the prieſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The very place it ſelfe of Chryſoſtome telleth, that the prieſtes did celebrate the ſacrifice daylie, whether the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came or no, which they would neuer haue done, if it had bene deadly ſinne ſo to doe. Therefore it is plaine, that they did ſacrifice, they did ſtand at the aultare, and cryed, but al in vaine, <hi>ſancta ſanctis.</hi> Holy things to holy men. <hi>Cum ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more &amp; charitate dei accedite.</hi> Come vp to receiue with the feare of God and charitie, and yet no man came.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I put the caſe (as I haue ſeene it chaunce) that when the prieſt had conſecrate, and one or two were commed vp to the aultar, and kneeled downe to communicate with the prieſt after the prieſt had receiued, they both departed and went away, not receauing eyther of contempt, or for that ſome ſodaine diſeaſe or paſsion came vpon them that they could not receaue: is God ſo vnmercifull as to condemne the prieſt for the caſualtie of an other man which lyeth not in his power to auoyde? Our ſaluation were a very tickle thing if one man ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit deadly ſinne againſt his will intending to ſerue god, &amp; ſo be condemned for the chaunce of an other man which he could not ſtop or amend, &amp; was no cauſe of it. Yea but (ſay they) Chryſoſtome ſayth. <hi>Non es hoſtia dignus nec co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munione, igitur nec oratione.</hi> If a man make his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that he is not worthy the ſacrifice, nor to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, then is he not worthy to be preſent there at the prayer. He ſaith ſo in dede. But what is this, to that the prieſt ſhould not receiue al one? nothing at al. And yet it ſerueth vs to declare that Chryſoſtome intended nothing elſe, but to reproue the negligence of them, that ſtoode in the place of the worthy receiuers and would not come to receaue. We muſt conſider in the Greeke Church, howe there was certaine degrees of the placing of the people, the prieſts ſtood at the aultar, the Clarkes within the Chauncell, the worthye receauers, in a diſtinct place beſide the prieſtes, the penitents in a lower
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:9612:202"/> place, the Catechumine which were men, learning oure faith, and not yet chriſtened ſate loweſt of all, but they were put out of the Church, when the ſermon and teaching was done, and were not ſuffered to be preſent at the myſteries. Nowe the lack that men doe not vnderſtand the diſtinction of theſe ſeuerall places maketh them to take Chryſoſtome wrong. For in deede he that is in the higher place of the communicants, and being there thinketh himſelfe for his vncleane life not worthy to communicate, and ſo decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the expectation of the prieſt that prepareth for him: is likewiſe not worthy to communicate in onely prayer, as being in that place, &amp; yet hath moſt neede of all to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in praier, becauſe praier is an humilytie of the mind and a cauſe and degree to make a man worthy to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the ſacrament. And therefore by Chryſoſtome he is not forbid to communicate in praier, but not in that place, but lower among thr penitents. For ſo Chryſoſtome ſayth by and by after. <hi>Quotquot eſtis in poenitentia omnes orate.</hi> All you that be penitents, occupie your ſelues in prayer. And it was a decree of the whole catholike Church, that certaine men which were not ſuffered to communicate in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſhould during their penaunce communicate onely in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>

Wee may ſee by this, that the meaning of Chryſoſtome is, as I haue declared. Other make an argument of the worde <hi>Communio,</hi> that the ſacrament is called a communion, becauſe many receaued it. But this argument is vnlearned, proceeding of ignoraunce. For it is ſo called, not for that many commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate together in one place, but for the effect of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

            <p>
               <hi>I ſhal make confeſsion before al you reuerende and holy fathers, geue me I pray you a good abſolution. It chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me once about midnight ſodainely to awake, than the Deuill Sathan began with me this diſputation. Heare (ſaid he) Doctor Luther, very well learned, thou knoweſt thou
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:9612:205"/> haſt ſaide priuate Maſſes .xv. yeres almoſt daylie. What if ſuch priuate Maſſes be horrible ydolatry? what if there were not preſent the body and bloud of Chriſt, but thou haddeſt honored onely bread and wine, and haddeſt cauſed other to honor it? to whome I aunſwered, I am an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted prieſt, and haue receyued vnction and conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Byſhop, &amp; haue done all theſe things by commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and obedience of mine elders. Why ſhould not I conſecrate, when I haue pronounced the wordes of Chriſt and haue ſaid Maſſe in earneſt? this thou knoweſt. All thys ſaide he is true, but the Turkes and Gentiles doe likewiſe all things in their temples of obedience and in earneſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The prieſtes of Hieroboam did all they did of a certain zeale and intent againſt the true prieſtes in Hieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What if they ordering and conſecrating were falſe, as the prieſtes of the Turkes and Samaritanes were falſe and their ſeruice of God falſe and wicked? Firſt (ſaid he) thou knoweſt thou haddeſt than no knowledge of Chriſt, nor true faith, and for fayth thou waſt no better than a Turke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Turke and all the Deuils alſo beleeue the ſtory of Chriſt, that he was borne, crucified, and dead. &amp;c. But the Turke and we damned ſpirites doe not truſt to hys mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, nor haue not him for a mediator and ſauiour, but feare him as a cruell iudge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such a faith and no other haddeſt thou, when thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueſt vnction of the Byſhop and all other both they that did annoynt, &amp; were annoynted, thought ſo and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Chriſt. Therfore ye fled from Chriſt as a cruell iudge to bleſſed Mary &amp; the ſaints, they were mediators betwene you and Chriſt, thus was Chriſt robbed of his glory, thys neyther thou nor no other Papiſt can denie. I would reade more of this booke but for troubling you. He that liſt to knowe what may bee ſayde againſt priuate Maſſe, let him learne here of the Deuill ynough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For here is all that hath yet beene ſayde of any other, and more to. The Deuils derlings were aſhamed to ſay halfe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:9612:205"/> ſo much as their father Sathan, leaſt they ſhould be called blaſphemous lyers as he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But by this booke, Luthers owne confeſsion ſet forth in print by himſelfe to the worlde ye may know that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill was the firſt that euer barked againſt the ſacrifice of the church, which is the Maſſe, knowing that his kingdome of ſinne and iniquitie coulde not ſtande, if this ſacrifice moſt aduerſarie to it, were not defaced and deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what colour had Luther to publiſhe this, ſhall wee thinke he was ſo madde as to father that vpon the Deuill, that he would haue perſwaded for truth to the worlde? I ſhall tell you ſhortly his fonde deuiſe in this point, as it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth fiue or ſixe leaues hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſayth he knoweth the Deuill is a lyer, but (he ſayth) his lyes be craftie, he vſeth to alledge a truth which can not be denyed, and with that to colour his lye which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore (ſayth he) the Deuill lyeth not when he accuſeth, as that I had committed horrible ydolatrye in ſaying priuate Maſſes: but the lye is when he did afterward tempt him to diſpaire of Gods mercy. But ſayth Luther I will not diſpaire as Iudas dyd, but amend that I haue done amiſſe and neuer ſay priuate Maſſe againe. O what a cloke of miſchiefe is this, &amp; all grounded of lyes and falſhood. He ſayth the Deuill lyeth not when he accuſeth. If that be true then he ſayde true when he ſayde that Luther being a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher many yeares, neuer had true fayth in Chriſt till he fell from the Maſſe, nor neuer truſted in Chriſtes mercy, nor neuer toke him for a ſauiour but a cruell iudge. Of this the Deuill did accuſe him, whether he was a lyer herein or no iudge you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo in his accuſation he ſayde the body and bloud of Chriſt were not preſent in the ſacrament, when ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed prieſtes did conſecrate, and that they honored one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread and wine, with many other damnable lyes and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, which whoſo ſhall read the booke, may finde in great
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:9612:206"/> plenty, and yet by Luthers principle, the deuill neuer ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth when he accuſeth.</hi>

            <p>Foure falſehoodes you affirme, in leſſe then twentie lynes togither of your printed Copie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>CROWLEY.</hi> Foure lyes affirmed in leſſe then twentie lines togither.</note> in this part to conclude withall. And ſo manyfeſt falſehoodes: that ſcarcely any one of your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie could be ſo ignorant, but that the ſame muſt perceyue that you lyed falſely, the communion, by your owne confeſſion in this Sermon, more then once: was heard of and vſed euen from the Apoſtles tyme. For <hi>Dioniſius Areopagita,</hi> was ſaint Paules ſcholer: &amp; you ſay that he ſpeaketh of it in his <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> more then once. The action that you call Maſſing, and we priuate Maſſing: was written againſt by many before it was brought into the Church, and by ſome after it was in vſe, many yeres before <hi>Luther</hi> was borne, as by <hi>Barthram, Huſſe, Wycklife,</hi> and <hi>Berrengarius.</hi> And although it haue pleaſed <hi>Pigghius</hi> and ſuch other, to blowe abroad this ſlaunderous lye, to the diſcredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine, as much as in them lyeth, and you alſo to dubbe their lye in the preſence of your Prince, who could be contented to heare whatſoeuer euill might be reported of that man and ſuch as he was: yet there is none that will examine the booke that you ſpeake of, but the ſame ſhall be inforced to ſay, that it can not iuſtly be gathered thereof, that <hi>Luther</hi> did eyther ſée the Deuill with his bodyly eyes, or heare him with his bodily eares. But ſuch is the priuiledge of the Popes Prelates, when they haue the ſworde on their ſide: they may vſe all vntruth in perſwading the people (but eſpecially princes) to thinke that all is lyes that the enimies of Antichriſts religion, haue eyther ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or written.</p>
            <p>You are bolde therfore, to laſhe out theſe thrée lyes before your Prince, and to make vp the matter with the fourth: affirming that he learned of the Deuill all that he hath ſpoken againſt your holy Maſſe. And when you thinke that you haue gotten your ſelfe ſome credit in this matter by reading a péece of <hi>Luthers</hi> booke, and leauing of before you come to that wherein his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is made plaine: you conclude that hereby it may be known,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:9612:206"/> that the Deuil was the firſt that barked againſt the Maſſe, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the greateſt aduerſarie of his kingdome, which could not ſtande vnleſſe that aduerſarie were defaced and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The diligent reader of this mine aunſwere, may eaſily ſée: howe the Maſſe hath defaced and deſtroyed the kingdome of the Deuill, in thoſe places where it hath bene moſt vſed, and in thoſe perſons that haue moſt frequented it. Yea, they that will but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the lyfe and conuerſation of them that at this day be Maſſemongers: ſhall ſoone ſée, how great an enimie the Maſſe is to the Deuils kingdome.</p>
            <p>Yea though there were none other euill in them,<note place="margin">The Maſſe alone is able to holde vp the Deuils kingdome.</note> then onely that they ſay and heare Maſſe (which is ydolatry): yet were this one euill ſufficient of it ſelfe, to holde vp the kingdome of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. But admit that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maſſe were no ydolatry: yet it is alwaies accompanied with a multitude of groſſe ydolatries. As the inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of creatures, the opinion of meryting by mens owne workes, the repreſenting of God to the bodily eye, by an Image made lyke a man, the bowing of the knées, and burning of Wax and Incenſe before the Images of creatures, truſt &amp; confidence in the holyneſſe of creatures, made holy by men, and ſuch lyke. Thus is the Maſſe the greateſt aduerſarie that the Deuils king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath.</p>
            <p>But leaſt ſome of your Auditorie ſhould take paynes to read <hi>Luthers</hi> booke, and ſo perceyue, that you haue not ſayde truely of him: you thinke to preuent that matter, by ſpeaking a fewe wordes of that part of the booke, that openeth the meaning of the hole, and knitting vp your tale with this exclamation. O what a cloke of miſchiefe is this, and all grounded vpon lyes and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. He ſayth the Deuill lyeth not when he accuſeth. &amp;c. And if this ſaying of <hi>Luther</hi> be true: then there will folow a number of as great inconueniences, as vpon the wordes of Dauid, when he ſayth, <hi>Omnis homo mendax.</hi> Euery man is a lyar.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſam..</hi> 115.</note> If <hi>Luther</hi> were in this lyfe: he would not ſticke to graunt all that you conclude vpon that propoſition that you call his principle. For which of the two may be thought better, the fayth of a Turke, or of a Maſſemonger? Seing the one denieth Chriſt in wordes, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:9612:207"/> him to be his ſauiour: and the other in déedes, in ſéeking ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by other meanes then by Chriſt, which is to denie him. And wherein ſhall Hieroboams prieſtes be found worſe then the Popes Maſſing prieſtes? If you wil read the prophecie of <hi>Oſeas,</hi> and vnderſtande it: you ſhall finde that they had as good a colour of obſeruing Moſes his lawe, as the Popes prieſtes haue of kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Chriſts inſtitution. And ſo of the reaſt, that you doe name damnable hereſies. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
